<p>Abstract:<br>Recently, the ability of language models (LMs) has attracted increasing attention in visual cross-modality. In this paper, we further explore the generation capacity of LMs for sound event detection (SED), beyond the visual domain. Specifically, we propose an elegant method that aligns audio features and text features to accomplish sound event classification and temporal location. The framework consists of an acoustic encoder, a contrastive module that align the corresponding representations of the text and audio, and a decoupled language decoder that generates temporal and event sequences from the audio characteristic. Compared with conventional works that require complicated processing and barely utilize limited audio features, our model is more concise and comprehensive since language model directly leverage its semantic capabilities to generate the sequences. We investigate different decoupling modules to demonstrate the effectiveness for timestamps capture and event classification. Evaluation results show that the proposed method achieves accurate sequences of sound event detection.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The field of multi-object tracking has recently seen a renewed interest in the good old schema of tracking-by-detection, as its simplicity and strong priors spare it from the complex design and painful babysitting of tracking-by-attention approaches. In view of this, we aim at extending tracking-by-detection to multi-modal settings, where a comprehensive cost has to be computed from heterogeneous information e.g., 2D motion cues, visual appearance, and pose estimates. More precisely, we follow a case study where a rough estimate of 3D information is also available and must be merged with other traditional metrics (e.g., the IoU). To achieve that, recent approaches resort to either simple rules or complex heuristics to balance the contribution of each cost. However, i) they require careful tuning of tailored hyperparameters on a hold-out set, and ii) they imply these costs to be independent, which does not hold in reality. We address these issues by building upon an elegant probabilistic formulation, which considers the cost of a candidate association as the negative log-likelihood yielded by a deep density estimator, trained to model the conditional joint probability distribution of correct associations. Our experiments, conducted on both simulated and real benchmarks, show that our approach consistently enhances the performance of several tracking-by-detection algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Social media users often hold several accounts in their effort to multiply the spread of their thoughts, ideas, and viewpoints. In the particular case of objectionable content, users tend to create multiple accounts to bypass the combating measures enforced by social media platforms and thus retain their online identity even if some of their accounts are suspended. User identity linkage aims to reveal social media accounts likely to belong to the same natural person so as to prevent the spread of abusive&#x2F;illegal activities. To this end, this work proposes a machine learning-based detection model, which uses multiple attributes of users’ online activity in order to identify whether two or more virtual identities belong to the same real natural person. The models efficacy is demonstrated on two cases on abusive and terrorism-related Twitter content.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various NLP tasks. However, previous works have shown these models are sensitive towards prompt wording, and few-shot demonstrations and their order, posing challenges to fair assessment of these models. As these models become more powerful, it becomes imperative to understand and address these limitations. In this paper, we focus on LLMs robustness on the task of multiple-choice questions – commonly adopted task to study reasoning and fact-retrieving capability of LLMs. Investigating the sensitivity of LLMs towards the order of options in multiple-choice questions, we demonstrate a considerable performance gap of approximately 13% to 75% in LLMs on different benchmarks, when answer options are reordered, even when using demonstrations in a few-shot setting. Through a detailed analysis, we conjecture that this sensitivity arises when LLMs are uncertain about the prediction between the top-2&#x2F;3 choices, and specific options placements may favor certain prediction between those top choices depending on the question caused by positional bias. We also identify patterns in top-2 choices that amplify or mitigate the model’s bias toward option placement. We found that for amplifying bias, the optimal strategy involves positioning the top two choices as the first and last options. Conversely, to mitigate bias, we recommend placing these choices among the adjacent options. To validate our conjecture, we conduct various experiments and adopt two approaches to calibrate LLMs’ predictions, leading to up to 8 percentage points improvement across different models and benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Improving the reliability of deployed machine learning systems often involves developing methods to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. However, existing research often narrowly focuses on samples from classes that are absent from the training set, neglecting other types of plausible distribution shifts. This limitation reduces the applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios, where systems encounter a wide variety of anomalous inputs. In this study, we categorize five distinct types of distribution shifts and critically evaluate the performance of recent OOD detection methods on each of them. We publicly release our benchmark under the name BROAD (Benchmarking Resilience Over Anomaly Diversity). Our findings reveal that while these methods excel in detecting unknown classes, their performance is inconsistent when encountering other types of distribution shifts. In other words, they only reliably detect unexpected inputs that they have been specifically designed to expect. As a first step toward broad OOD detection, we learn a generative model of existing detection scores with a Gaussian mixture. By doing so, we present an ensemble approach that offers a more consistent and comprehensive solution for broad OOD detection, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. Our code to download BROAD and reproduce our experiments is publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Decision trees are highly interpretable models for solving classification problems in machine learning (ML). The standard ML algorithms for training decision trees are fast but generate suboptimal trees in terms of accuracy. Other discrete optimization models in the literature address the optimality problem but only work well on relatively small datasets. \cite{firat2020column} proposed a column-generation-based heuristic approach for learning decision trees. This approach improves scalability and can work with large datasets. In this paper, we describe improvements to this column generation approach. First, we modify the subproblem model to significantly reduce the number of subproblems in multiclass classification instances. Next, we show that the data-dependent constraints in the master problem are implied, and use them as cutting planes. Furthermore, we describe a separation model to generate data points for which the linear programming relaxation solution violates their corresponding constraints. We conclude by presenting computational results that show that these modifications result in better scalability.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recent strides in Text-to-3D techniques have been propelled by distilling knowledge from powerful large text-to-image diffusion models (LDMs). Nonetheless, existing Text-to-3D approaches often grapple with challenges such as over-saturation, inadequate detailing, and unrealistic outputs. This study presents a novel strategy that leverages explicitly synthesized multi-view images to address these issues. Our approach involves the utilization of image-to-image pipelines, empowered by LDMs, to generate posed high-quality images based on the renderings of coarse 3D models. Although the generated images mostly alleviate the aforementioned issues, challenges such as view inconsistency and significant content variance persist due to the inherent generative nature of large diffusion models, posing extensive difficulties in leveraging these images effectively. To overcome this hurdle, we advocate integrating a discriminator alongside a novel Diffusion-GAN dual training strategy to guide the training of 3D models. For the incorporated discriminator, the synthesized multi-view images are considered real data, while the renderings of the optimized 3D models function as fake data. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over baseline approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This work targets what we consider to be the foundational step for urban airborne robots, a safe landing. Our attention is directed toward what we deem the most crucial aspect of the safe landing perception stack: segmentation. We present a streamlined reactive UAV system that employs visual servoing by harnessing the capabilities of open vocabulary image segmentation. This approach can adapt to various scenarios with minimal adjustments, bypassing the necessity for extensive data accumulation for refining internal models, thanks to its open vocabulary methodology. Given the limitations imposed by local authorities, our primary focus centers on operations originating from altitudes of 100 meters. This choice is deliberate, as numerous preceding works have dealt with altitudes up to 30 meters, aligning with the capabilities of small stereo cameras. Consequently, we leave the remaining 20m to be navigated using conventional 3D path planning methods. Utilizing monocular cameras and image segmentation, our findings demonstrate the system’s capability to successfully execute landing maneuvers at altitudes as low as 20 meters. However, this approach is vulnerable to intermittent and occasionally abrupt fluctuations in the segmentation between frames in a video stream. To address this challenge, we enhance the image segmentation output by introducing what we call a dynamic focus: a masking mechanism that self adjusts according to the current landing stage. This dynamic focus guides the control system to avoid regions beyond the drone’s safety radius projected onto the ground, thus mitigating the problems with fluctuations. Through the implementation of this supplementary layer, our experiments have reached improvements in the landing success rate of almost tenfold when compared to global segmentation. All the source code is open source and available online (github.com&#x2F;MISTLab&#x2F;DOVESEI).</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Federated learning (FL) inevitably confronts the challenge of system heterogeneity in practical scenarios. To enhance the capabilities of most model-homogeneous FL methods in handling system heterogeneity, we propose a training scheme that can extend their capabilities to cope with this challenge. In this paper, we commence our study with a detailed exploration of homogeneous and heterogeneous FL settings and discover three key observations: (1) a positive correlation between client performance and layer similarities, (2) higher similarities in the shallow layers in contrast to the deep layers, and (3) the smoother gradients distributions indicate the higher layer similarities. Building upon these observations, we propose InCo Aggregation that leverags internal cross-layer gradients, a mixture of gradients from shallow and deep layers within a server model, to augment the similarity in the deep layers without requiring additional communication between clients. Furthermore, our methods can be tailored to accommodate model-homogeneous FL methods such as FedAvg, FedProx, FedNova, Scaffold, and MOON, to expand their capabilities to handle the system heterogeneity. Copious experimental results validate the effectiveness of InCo Aggregation, spotlighting internal cross-layer gradients as a promising avenue to enhance the performance in heterogenous FL.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Learning meaningful representations is at the heart of many tasks in the field of modern machine learning. Recently, a lot of methods were introduced that allow learning of image representations without supervision. These representations can then be used in downstream tasks like classification or object detection. The quality of these representations is close to supervised learning, while no labeled images are needed. This survey paper provides a comprehensive review of these methods in a unified notation, points out similarities and differences of these methods, and proposes a taxonomy which sets these methods in relation to each other. Furthermore, our survey summarizes the most-recent experimental results reported in the literature in form of a meta-study. Our survey is intended as a starting point for researchers and practitioners who want to dive into the field of representation learning.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We provide the first convergence guarantees for the Consistency Models (CMs), a newly emerging type of one-step generative models that can generate comparable samples to those generated by Diffusion Models. Our main result is that, under the basic assumptions on score-matching errors, consistency errors and smoothness of the data distribution, CMs can efficiently sample from any realistic data distribution in one step with small $W_2$ error. Our results (1) hold for $L^2$-accurate score and consistency assumption (rather than $L^\infty$-accurate); (2) do note require strong assumptions on the data distribution such as log-Sobelev inequality; (3) scale polynomially in all parameters; and (4) match the state-of-the-art convergence guarantee for score-based generative models (SGMs). We also provide the result that the Multistep Consistency Sampling procedure can further reduce the error comparing to one step sampling, which support the original statement of “Consistency Models, Yang Song 2023”. Our result further imply a TV error guarantee when take some Langevin-based modifications to the output distributions.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Aspect-based sentiment classification is a crucial problem in fine-grained sentiment analysis, which aims to predict the sentiment polarity of the given aspect according to its context. Previous works have made remarkable progress in leveraging attention mechanism to extract opinion words for different aspects. However, a persistent challenge is the effective management of semantic mismatches, which stem from attention mechanisms that fall short in adequately aligning opinions words with their corresponding aspect in multi-aspect sentences. To address this issue, we propose a novel Aspect-oriented Opinion Alignment Network (AOAN) to capture the contextual association between opinion words and the corresponding aspect. Specifically, we first introduce a neighboring span enhanced module which highlights various compositions of neighboring words and given aspects. In addition, we design a multi-perspective attention mechanism that align relevant opinion information with respect to the given aspect. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results.

<p>Abstract:<br>The machine learning modeling process conventionally culminates in selecting a single model that maximizes a selected performance metric. However, this approach leads to abandoning a more profound analysis of slightly inferior models. Particularly in medical and healthcare studies, where the objective extends beyond predictions to valuable insight generation, relying solely on performance metrics can result in misleading or incomplete conclusions. This problem is particularly pertinent when dealing with a set of models with performance close to maximum one, known as $\textit{Rashomon set}$. Such a set can be numerous and may contain models describing the data in a different way, which calls for comprehensive analysis. This paper introduces a novel process to explore Rashomon set models, extending the conventional modeling approach. The cornerstone is the identification of the most different models within the Rashomon set, facilitated by the introduced $\texttt{Rashomon_DETECT}$ algorithm. This algorithm compares profiles illustrating prediction dependencies on variable values generated by eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques. To quantify differences in variable effects among models, we introduce the Profile Disparity Index (PDI) based on measures from functional data analysis. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we showcase its application in predicting survival among hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) patients - a foundational case study. Additionally, we benchmark our approach on other medical data sets, demonstrating its versatility and utility in various contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>A person’s gender is a crucial piece of information when performing research across a wide range of scientific disciplines, such as medicine, sociology, political science, and economics, to name a few. However, in increasing instances, especially given the proliferation of big data, gender information is not readily available. In such cases researchers need to infer gender from readily available information, primarily from persons’ names. While inferring gender from name may raise some ethical questions, the lack of viable alternatives means that researchers have to resort to such approaches when the goal justifies the means - in the majority of such studies the goal is to examine patterns and determinants of gender disparities. The necessity of name-to-gender inference has generated an ever-growing domain of algorithmic approaches and software products. These approaches have been used throughout the world in academia, industry, governmental and non-governmental organizations. Nevertheless, the existing approaches have yet to be systematically evaluated and compared, making it challenging to determine the optimal approach for future research. In this work, we conducted a large scale performance evaluation of existing approaches for name-to-gender inference. Analysis are performed using a variety of large annotated datasets of names. We further propose two new hybrid approaches that achieve better performance than any single existing approach.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Autonomous agents have long been a prominent research topic in the academic community. Previous research in this field often focuses on training agents with limited knowledge within isolated environments, which diverges significantly from the human learning processes, and thus makes the agents hard to achieve human-like decisions. Recently, through the acquisition of vast amounts of web knowledge, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in achieving human-level intelligence. This has sparked an upsurge in studies investigating autonomous agents based on LLMs. To harness the full potential of LLMs, researchers have devised diverse agent architectures tailored to different applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these studies, delivering a systematic review of the field of autonomous agents from a holistic perspective. More specifically, our focus lies in the construction of LLM-based agents, for which we propose a unified framework that encompasses a majority of the previous work. Additionally, we provide a summary of the various applications of LLM-based AI agents in the domains of social science, natural science, and engineering. Lastly, we discuss the commonly employed evaluation strategies for LLM-based AI agents. Based on the previous studies, we also present several challenges and future directions in this field.

<p>Abstract:<br>The Potential Outcome Framework (POF) plays a prominent role in the field of causal inference. Most causal inference models based on the POF (CIMs-B-POF) are designed for eliminating confounding bias and default to an underlying assumption of Confounding Covariates. This assumption posits that the covariates consist solely of confounders. However, the assumption of Confounding Covariates is challenging to maintain in practice, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional covariates. While certain methods have been proposed to differentiate the distinct components of covariates prior to conducting causal inference, the consequences of treating non-confounding covariates as confounders remain unclear. This ambiguity poses a potential risk when applying the CIMs-B-POF in practical scenarios. In this paper, we present a unified graphical framework for the CIMs-B-POF, which greatly enhances the comprehension of these models’ underlying principles. Using this graphical framework, we quantitatively analyze the extent to which the inference performance of CIMs-B-POF is influenced when incorporating various types of non-confounding covariates, such as instrumental variables, mediators, colliders, and adjustment variables. The key findings are: in the task of eliminating confounding bias, the optimal scenario is for the covariates to exclusively encompass confounders; in the subsequent task of inferring counterfactual outcomes, the adjustment variables contribute to more accurate inferences. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted on synthetic datasets consistently validate these theoretical conclusions.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The future of the arts and artificial intelligence (AI) is promising as technology advances. As the use of AI in design becomes more widespread, art practice may not be a human-only art form and could instead become a digitally integrated experience. With enhanced creativity and collaboration, arts and AI could work together towards creating artistic outputs that are visually appealing and meet the needs of the artist and viewer. While it is uncertain how far the integration will go, arts and AI will likely influence one another. This workshop pictorial puts forward first-person research that shares interactions between an HCI researcher and AI as they try to escape the creative block. The pictorial paper explores two questions: How can AI support artists’ creativity, and what does it mean to be explainable in this context? HIs, ChatGPT and Midjourney were engaged; the result was a series of reflections that require further discussion and explorations in the XAIxArts community: Transparency of attribution, the creation process, ethics of asking, and inspiration vs copying.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Vision transformers have shown unprecedented levels of performance in tackling various visual perception tasks in recent years. However, the architectural and computational complexity of such network architectures have made them challenging to deploy in real-world applications with high-throughput, low-memory requirements. As such, there has been significant research recently on the design of efficient vision transformer architectures. In this study, we explore the generation of fast vision transformer architecture designs via generative architecture search (GAS) to achieve a strong balance between accuracy and architectural and computational efficiency. Through this generative architecture search process, we create TurboViT, a highly efficient hierarchical vision transformer architecture design that is generated around mask unit attention and Q-pooling design patterns. The resulting TurboViT architecture design achieves significantly lower architectural computational complexity (&gt;2.47$\times$ smaller than FasterViT-0 while achieving same accuracy) and computational complexity (&gt;3.4$\times$ fewer FLOPs and 0.9% higher accuracy than MobileViT2-2.0) when compared to 10 other state-of-the-art efficient vision transformer network architecture designs within a similar range of accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset. Furthermore, TurboViT demonstrated strong inference latency and throughput in both low-latency and batch processing scenarios (&gt;3.21$\times$ lower latency and &gt;3.18$\times$ higher throughput compared to FasterViT-0 for low-latency scenario). These promising results demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging generative architecture search for generating efficient transformer architecture designs for high-throughput scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Regression analysis is a key area of interest in the field of data analysis and machine learning which is devoted to exploring the dependencies between variables, often using vectors. The emergence of high dimensional data in technologies such as neuroimaging, computer vision, climatology and social networks, has brought challenges to traditional data representation methods. Tensors, as high dimensional extensions of vectors, are considered as natural representations of high dimensional data. In this book, the authors provide a systematic study and analysis of tensor-based regression models and their applications in recent years. It groups and illustrates the existing tensor-based regression methods and covers the basics, core ideas, and theoretical characteristics of most tensor-based regression methods. In addition, readers can learn how to use existing tensor-based regression methods to solve specific regression tasks with multiway data, what datasets can be selected, and what software packages are available to start related work as soon as possible. Tensor Regression is the first thorough overview of the fundamentals, motivations, popular algorithms, strategies for efficient implementation, related applications, available datasets, and software resources for tensor-based regression analysis. It is essential reading for all students, researchers and practitioners of working on high dimensional data.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Measures of algorithmic fairness are usually discussed in the context of binary decisions. We extend the approach to continuous scores. So far, ROC-based measures have mainly been suggested for this purpose. Other existing methods depend heavily on the distribution of scores, are unsuitable for ranking tasks, or their effect sizes are not interpretable. Here, we propose a distributionally invariant version of fairness measures for continuous scores with a reasonable interpretation based on the Wasserstein distance. Our measures are easily computable and well suited for quantifying and interpreting the strength of group disparities as well as for comparing biases across different models, datasets, or time points. We derive a link between the different families of existing fairness measures for scores and show that the proposed distributionally invariant fairness measures outperform ROC-based fairness measures because they are more explicit and can quantify significant biases that ROC-based fairness measures miss. Finally, we demonstrate their effectiveness through experiments on the most commonly used fairness benchmark datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Modeling long-term context in videos is crucial for many fine-grained tasks including temporal action segmentation. An interesting question that is still open is how much long-term temporal context is needed for optimal performance. While transformers can model the long-term context of a video, this becomes computationally prohibitive for long videos. Recent works on temporal action segmentation thus combine temporal convolutional networks with self-attentions that are computed only for a local temporal window. While these approaches show good results, their performance is limited by their inability to capture the full context of a video. In this work, we try to answer how much long-term temporal context is required for temporal action segmentation by introducing a transformer-based model that leverages sparse attention to capture the full context of a video. We compare our model with the current state of the art on three datasets for temporal action segmentation, namely 50Salads, Breakfast, and Assembly101. Our experiments show that modeling the full context of a video is necessary to obtain the best performance for temporal action segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Collecting diverse sets of training images for RGB-D semantic image segmentation is not always possible. In particular, when robots need to operate in privacy-sensitive areas like homes, the collection is often limited to a small set of locations. As a consequence, the annotated images lack diversity in appearance and approaches for RGB-D semantic image segmentation tend to overfit the training data. In this paper, we thus introduce semantic RGB-D image synthesis to address this problem. It requires synthesising a realistic-looking RGB-D image for a given semantic label map. Current approaches, however, are uni-modal and cannot cope with multi-modal data. Indeed, we show that extending uni-modal approaches to multi-modal data does not perform well. In this paper, we therefore propose a generator for multi-modal data that separates modal-independent information of the semantic layout from the modal-dependent information that is needed to generate an RGB and a depth image, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a discriminator that ensures semantic consistency between the label maps and the generated images and perceptual similarity between the real and generated images. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous uni-modal methods by a large margin and that the accuracy of an approach for RGB-D semantic segmentation can be significantly improved by mixing real and generated images during training.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Building AIs with adaptive behaviors in human-AI cooperation stands as a pivotal focus in AGI research. Current methods for developing cooperative agents predominantly rely on learning-based methods, where policy generalization heavily hinges on past interactions with specific teammates. These approaches constrain the agent’s capacity to recalibrate its strategy when confronted with novel teammates. We propose \textbf{ProAgent}, a novel framework that harnesses large language models (LLMs) to fashion a \textit{pro}active \textit{agent} empowered with the ability to anticipate teammates’ forthcoming decisions and formulate enhanced plans for itself. ProAgent excels at cooperative reasoning with the capacity to dynamically adapt its behavior to enhance collaborative efforts with teammates. Moreover, the ProAgent framework exhibits a high degree of modularity and interpretability, facilitating seamless integration to address a wide array of coordination scenarios. Experimental evaluations conducted within the framework of \textit{Overcook-AI} unveil the remarkable performance superiority of ProAgent, outperforming five methods based on self-play and population-based training in cooperation with AI agents. Further, when cooperating with human proxy models, its performance exhibits an average improvement exceeding 10% compared to the current state-of-the-art, COLE. The advancement was consistently observed across diverse scenarios involving interactions with both AI agents of varying characteristics and human counterparts. These findings inspire future research for human-robot collaborations.

<p>Abstract:<br>Reinforcement learning serves as a potent tool for modeling dynamic user interests within recommender systems, garnering increasing research attention of late. However, a significant drawback persists: its poor data efficiency, stemming from its interactive nature. The training of reinforcement learning-based recommender systems demands expensive online interactions to amass adequate trajectories, essential for agents to learn user preferences. This inefficiency renders reinforcement learning-based recommender systems a formidable undertaking, necessitating the exploration of potential solutions. Recent strides in offline reinforcement learning present a new perspective. Offline reinforcement learning empowers agents to glean insights from offline datasets and deploy learned policies in online settings. Given that recommender systems possess extensive offline datasets, the framework of offline reinforcement learning aligns seamlessly. Despite being a burgeoning field, works centered on recommender systems utilizing offline reinforcement learning remain limited. This survey aims to introduce and delve into offline reinforcement learning within recommender systems, offering an inclusive review of existing literature in this domain. Furthermore, we strive to underscore prevalent challenges, opportunities, and future pathways, poised to propel research in this evolving field.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Cross-modal pre-training has shown impressive performance on a wide range of downstream tasks, benefiting from massive image-text pairs collected from the Internet. In practice, online data are growing constantly, highlighting the importance of the ability of pre-trained model to learn from data that is continuously growing. Existing works on cross-modal pre-training mainly focus on training a network with fixed architecture. However, it is impractical to limit the model capacity when considering the continuously growing nature of pre-training data in real-world applications. On the other hand, it is important to utilize the knowledge in the current model to obtain efficient training and better performance. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose GrowCLIP, a data-driven automatic model growing algorithm for contrastive language-image pre-training with continuous image-text pairs as input. Specially, we adopt a dynamic growth space and seek out the optimal architecture at each growth step to adapt to online learning scenarios. And the shared encoder is proposed in our growth space to enhance the degree of cross-modal fusion. Besides, we explore the effect of growth in different dimensions, which could provide future references for the design of cross-modal model architecture. Finally, we employ parameter inheriting with momentum (PIM) to maintain the previous knowledge and address the issue of the local minimum dilemma. Compared with the existing methods, GrowCLIP improves 2.3% average top-1 accuracy on zero-shot image classification of 9 downstream tasks. As for zero-shot image retrieval, GrowCLIP can improve 1.2% for top-1 image-to-text recall on Flickr30K dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper illustrates how generative AI could give opportunities for big productivity gains but also opens up questions about the impact of these new powerful technologies on the way we work and share knowledge. More specifically, we explore how ChatGPT changed a fundamental aspect of coding: problem-solving. To do so, we exploit the effect of the sudden release of ChatGPT on the 30th of November 2022 on the usage of the largest online community for coders: Stack Overflow. Using quasi-experimental methods (Difference-in-Difference), we find a significant drop in the number of questions. In addition, the questions are better documented after the release of ChatGPT. Finally, we find evidence that the remaining questions are more complex. These findings suggest not only productivity gains but also a fundamental change in the way we work where routine inquiries are solved by AI allowing humans to focus on more complex tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The quality of a wood log in the wood industry depends heavily on the presence of both outer and inner defects, including inner knots that are a result of the growth of tree branches. Today, locating the inner knots require the use of expensive equipment such as X-ray scanners. In this paper, we address the task of predicting the location of inner defects from the outer shape of the logs. The dataset is built by extracting both the contours and the knots with X-ray measurements. We propose to solve this binary segmentation task by leveraging convolutional recurrent neural networks. Once the neural network is trained, inference can be performed from the outer shape measured with cheap devices such as laser profilers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on fir and spruce tree species and perform ablation on the recurrence to demonstrate its importance.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Understanding the dynamics of large quantum systems is hindered by the curse of dimensionality. Statistical learning offers new possibilities in this regime by neural-network protocols and classical shadows, while both methods have limitations: the former is plagued by the predictive uncertainty and the latter lacks the generalization ability. Here we propose a data-centric learning paradigm combining the strength of these two approaches to facilitate diverse quantum system learning (QSL) tasks. Particularly, our paradigm utilizes classical shadows along with other easily obtainable information of quantum systems to create the training dataset, which is then learnt by neural networks to unveil the underlying mapping rule of the explored QSL problem. Capitalizing on the generalization power of neural networks, this paradigm can be trained offline and excel at predicting previously unseen systems at the inference stage, even with few state copies. Besides, it inherits the characteristic of classical shadows, enabling memory-efficient storage and faithful prediction. These features underscore the immense potential of the proposed data-centric approach in discovering novel and large-scale quantum systems. For concreteness, we present the instantiation of our paradigm in quantum state tomography and direct fidelity estimation tasks and conduct numerical analysis up to 60 qubits. Our work showcases the profound prospects of data-centric artificial intelligence to advance QSL in a faithful and generalizable manner.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Motivated by the challenges of the Digital Ancient Near Eastern Studies (DANES) community, we develop digital tools for processing cuneiform script being a 3D script imprinted into clay tablets used for more than three millennia and at least eight major languages. It consists of thousands of characters that have changed over time and space. Photographs are the most common representations usable for machine learning, while ink drawings are prone to interpretation. Best suited 3D datasets that are becoming available. We created and used the HeiCuBeDa and MaiCuBeDa datasets, which consist of around 500 annotated tablets. For our novel OCR-like approach to mixed image data, we provide an additional mapping tool for transferring annotations between 3D renderings and photographs. Our sign localization uses a RepPoints detector to predict the locations of characters as bounding boxes. We use image data from GigaMesh’s MSII (curvature, see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gigamesh.eu/">https://gigamesh.eu</a>) based rendering, Phong-shaded 3D models, and photographs as well as illumination augmentation. The results show that using rendered 3D images for sign detection performs better than other work on photographs. In addition, our approach gives reasonably good results for photographs only, while it is best used for mixed datasets.

<p>Abstract:<br>Text-to-music generation (T2M-Gen) faces a major obstacle due to the scarcity of large-scale publicly available music datasets with natural language captions. To address this, we propose the Music Understanding LLaMA (MU-LLaMA), capable of answering music-related questions and generating captions for music files. Our model utilizes audio representations from a pretrained MERT model to extract music features. However, obtaining a suitable dataset for training the MU-LLaMA model remains challenging, as existing publicly accessible audio question answering datasets lack the necessary depth for open-ended music question answering. To fill this gap, we present a methodology for generating question-answer pairs from existing audio captioning datasets and introduce the MusicQA Dataset designed for answering open-ended music-related questions. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed MU-LLaMA model, trained on our designed MusicQA dataset, achieves outstanding performance in both music question answering and music caption generation across various metrics, outperforming current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in both fields and offering a promising advancement in the T2M-Gen research field.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The robust constrained Markov decision process (RCMDP) is a recent task-modelling framework for reinforcement learning that incorporates behavioural constraints and that provides robustness to errors in the transition dynamics model through the use of an uncertainty set. Simulating RCMDPs requires computing the worst-case dynamics based on value estimates for each state, an approach which has previously been used in the Robust Constrained Policy Gradient (RCPG). Highlighting potential downsides of RCPG such as not robustifying the full constrained objective and the lack of incremental learning, this paper introduces two algorithms, called RCPG with Robust Lagrangian and Adversarial RCPG. RCPG with Robust Lagrangian modifies RCPG by taking the worst-case dynamics based on the Lagrangian rather than either the value or the constraint. Adversarial RCPG also formulates the worst-case dynamics based on the Lagrangian but learns this directly and incrementally as an adversarial policy through gradient descent rather than indirectly and abruptly through constrained optimisation on a sorted value list. A theoretical analysis first derives the Lagrangian policy gradient for the policy optimisation of both proposed algorithms and then the adversarial policy gradient to learn the adversary for Adversarial RCPG. Empirical experiments injecting perturbations in inventory management and safe navigation tasks demonstrate the competitive performance of both algorithms compared to traditional RCPG variants as well as non-robust and non-constrained ablations. In particular, Adversarial RCPG ranks among the top two performing algorithms on all tests.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>No-regret algorithms are popular for learning Nash equilibrium (NE) in two-player zero-sum normal-form games (NFGs) and extensive-form games (EFGs). Many recent works consider the last-iterate convergence no-regret algorithms. Among them, the two most famous algorithms are Optimistic Gradient Descent Ascent (OGDA) and Optimistic Multiplicative Weight Update (OMWU). However, OGDA has high per-iteration complexity. OMWU exhibits a lower per-iteration complexity but poorer empirical performance, and its convergence holds only when NE is unique. Recent works propose a Reward Transformation (RT) framework for MWU, which removes the uniqueness condition and achieves competitive performance with OMWU. Unfortunately, RT-based algorithms perform worse than OGDA under the same number of iterations, and their convergence guarantee is based on the continuous-time feedback assumption, which does not hold in most scenarios. To address these issues, we provide a closer analysis of the RT framework, which holds for both continuous and discrete-time feedback. We demonstrate that the essence of the RT framework is to transform the problem of learning NE in the original game into a series of strongly convex-concave optimization problems (SCCPs). We show that the bottleneck of RT-based algorithms is the speed of solving SCCPs. To improve the their empirical performance, we design a novel transformation method to enable the SCCPs can be solved by Regret Matching+ (RM+), a no-regret algorithm with better empirical performance, resulting in Reward Transformation RM+ (RTRM+). RTRM+ enjoys last-iterate convergence under the discrete-time feedback setting. Using the counterfactual regret decomposition framework, we propose Reward Transformation CFR+ (RTCFR+) to extend RTRM+ to EFGs. Experimental results show that our algorithms significantly outperform existing last-iterate convergence algorithms and RM+ (CFR+).</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Current research on bias in machine learning often focuses on fairness, while overlooking the roots or causes of bias. However, bias was originally defined as a “systematic error,” often caused by humans at different stages of the research process. This article aims to bridge the gap between past literature on bias in research by providing taxonomy for potential sources of bias and errors in data and models. The paper focus on bias in machine learning pipelines. Survey analyses over forty potential sources of bias in the machine learning (ML) pipeline, providing clear examples for each. By understanding the sources and consequences of bias in machine learning, better methods can be developed for its detecting and mitigating, leading to fairer, more transparent, and more accurate ML models.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Tablature notation is widely used in popular music to transcribe and share guitar musical content. As a complement to standard score notation, tablatures transcribe performance gesture information including finger positions and a variety of guitar-specific playing techniques such as slides, hammer-on&#x2F;pull-off or bends.This paper focuses on bends, which enable to progressively shift the pitch of a note, therefore circumventing physical limitations of the discrete fretted fingerboard. In this paper, we propose a set of 25 high-level features, computed for each note of the tablature, to study how bend occurrences can be predicted from their past and future short-term context. Experiments are performed on a corpus of 932 lead guitar tablatures of popular music and show that a decision tree successfully predicts bend occurrences with an F1 score of 0.71 anda limited amount of false positive predictions, demonstrating promising applications to assist the arrangement of non-guitar music into guitar tablatures.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Fault diagnosis is an essential component in process supervision. Indeed, it determines which kind of fault has occurred, given that it has been previously detected, allowing for appropriate intervention. Automatic fault diagnosis systems use machine learning for predicting the fault type from sensor readings. Nonetheless, these models are sensible to changes in the data distributions, which may be caused by changes in the monitored process, such as changes in the mode of operation. This scenario is known as Cross-Domain Fault Diagnosis (CDFD). We provide an extensive comparison of single and multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation (SSDA and MSDA respectively) algorithms for CDFD. We study these methods in the context of the Tennessee-Eastmann Process, a widely used benchmark in the chemical industry. We show that using multiple domains during training has a positive effect, even when no adaptation is employed. As such, the MSDA baseline improves over the SSDA baseline classification accuracy by 23% on average. In addition, under the multiple-sources scenario, we improve classification accuracy of the no adaptation setting by 8.4% on average.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>3D scene graphs hierarchically represent the environment appropriately organizing different environmental entities in various layers. Our previous work on situational graphs extends the concept of 3D scene graph to SLAM by tightly coupling the robot poses with the scene graph entities, achieving state-of-the-art results. Though, one of the limitations of S-Graphs is scalability in really large environments due to the increased graph size over time, increasing the computational complexity.   To overcome this limitation in this work we present an initial research of an improved version of S-Graphs exploiting the hierarchy to reduce the graph size by marginalizing redundant robot poses and their connections to the observations of the same structural entities. Firstly, we propose the generation and optimization of room-local graphs encompassing all graph entities within a room-like structure. These room-local graphs are used to compress the S-Graphs marginalizing the redundant robot keyframes within the given room. We then perform windowed local optimization of the compressed graph at regular time-distance intervals. A global optimization of the compressed graph is performed every time a loop closure is detected. We show similar accuracy compared to the baseline while showing a 39.81% reduction in the computation time with respect to the baseline.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Wav2vec2 has achieved success in applying Transformer architecture and self-supervised learning to speech recognition. Recently, these have come to be used not only for speech recognition but also for the entire speech processing. This paper introduces an effective end-to-end speaker identification model applied Transformer-based contextual model. We explored the relationship between the parameters and the performance in order to discern the structure of an effective model. Furthermore, we propose a pooling method, Temporal Gate Pooling, with powerful learning ability for speaker identification. We applied Conformer as encoder and BEST-RQ for pre-training and conducted an evaluation utilizing the speaker identification of VoxCeleb1. The proposed method has achieved an accuracy of 85.9% with 28.5M parameters, demonstrating comparable precision to wav2vec2 with 317.7M parameters.

<p>Abstract:<br>In this paper, we argue that the next generation of robots can be commanded using only Language Models’ prompts. Every prompt interrogates separately a specific Robotic Modality via its Modality Language Model (MLM). A central Task Modality mediates the whole communication to execute the robotic mission via a Large Language Model (LLM). This paper gives this new robotic design pattern the name of: Prompting Robotic Modalities (PRM). Moreover, this paper applies this PRM design pattern in building a new robotic framework named ROSGPT_Vision. ROSGPT_Vision allows the execution of a robotic task using only two prompts: a Visual and an LLM prompt. The Visual Prompt extracts, in natural language, the visual semantic features related to the task under consideration (Visual Robotic Modality). Meanwhile, the LLM Prompt regulates the robotic reaction to the visual description (Task Modality). The framework automates all the mechanisms behind these two prompts. The framework enables the robot to address complex real-world scenarios by processing visual data, making informed decisions, and carrying out actions automatically. The framework comprises one generic vision module and two independent ROS nodes. As a test application, we used ROSGPT_Vision to develop CarMate, which monitors the driver’s distraction on the roads and makes real-time vocal notifications to the driver. We showed how ROSGPT_Vision significantly reduced the development cost compared to traditional methods. We demonstrated how to improve the quality of the application by optimizing the prompting strategies, without delving into technical details. ROSGPT_Vision is shared with the community (link: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/bilel-bj/ROSGPT_Vision">https://github.com/bilel-bj/ROSGPT_Vision</a>) to advance robotic research in this direction and to build more robotic frameworks that implement the PRM design pattern and enables controlling robots using only prompts.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has found wide application, but also poses risks due to unintentional or malicious tampering during deployment. Regular checks are therefore necessary to detect and prevent such risks. Fragile watermarking is a technique used to identify tampering in AI models. However, previous methods have faced challenges including risks of omission, additional information transmission, and inability to locate tampering precisely. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting tampered parameters and bits, which can be used to detect, locate, and restore parameters that have been tampered with. We also propose an adaptive embedding method that maximizes information capacity while maintaining model accuracy. Our approach was tested on multiple neural networks subjected to attacks that modified weight parameters, and our results demonstrate that our method achieved great recovery performance when the modification rate was below 20%. Furthermore, for models where watermarking significantly affected accuracy, we utilized an adaptive bit technique to recover more than 15% of the accuracy loss of the model.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a fundamental problem in robotics that asks us to compute collision-free paths for a team of agents, all moving across a shared map. Although many works appear on this topic, all current algorithms struggle as the number of agents grows. The principal reason is that existing approaches typically plan free-flow optimal paths, which creates congestion. To tackle this issue we propose a new approach for MAPF where agents are guided to their destination by following congestion-avoiding paths. We evaluate the idea in two large-scale settings: one-shot MAPF, where each agent has a single destination, and lifelong MAPF, where agents are continuously assigned new tasks. For one-shot MAPF we show that our approach substantially improves solution quality. For Lifelong MAPF we report large improvements in overall throughput.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Information Technology has become a critical component in various industries, leading to an increased focus on software maintenance and monitoring. With the complexities of modern software systems, traditional maintenance approaches have become insufficient. The concept of AIOps has emerged to enhance predictive maintenance using Big Data and Machine Learning capabilities. However, exploiting AIOps requires addressing several challenges related to the complexity of data and incident management. Commercial solutions exist, but they may not be suitable for certain companies due to high costs, data governance issues, and limitations in covering private software. This paper investigates the feasibility of implementing on-premise AIOps solutions by leveraging open-source tools. We introduce a comprehensive AIOps infrastructure that we have successfully deployed in our company, and we provide the rationale behind different choices that we made to build its various components. Particularly, we provide insights into our approach and criteria for selecting a data management system and we explain its integration. Our experience can be beneficial for companies seeking to internally manage their software maintenance processes with a modern AIOps approach.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered considerable interest within both academic and industrial. Yet, the application of LLMs to graph data remains under-explored. In this study, we evaluate the capabilities of four LLMs in addressing several analytical problems with graph data. We employ four distinct evaluation metrics: Comprehension, Correctness, Fidelity, and Rectification. Our results show that: 1) LLMs effectively comprehend graph data in natural language and reason with graph topology. 2) GPT models can generate logical and coherent results, outperforming alternatives in correctness. 3) All examined LLMs face challenges in structural reasoning, with techniques like zero-shot chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting showing diminished efficacy. 4) GPT models often produce erroneous answers in multi-answer tasks, raising concerns in fidelity. 5) GPT models exhibit elevated confidence in their outputs, potentially hindering their rectification capacities. Notably, GPT-4 has demonstrated the capacity to rectify responses from GPT-3.5-turbo and its own previous iterations.

<p>Abstract:<br>The field of women’s endocrinology has trailed behind data-driven medical solutions, largely due to concerns over the privacy of patient data. Valuable datapoints about hormone levels or menstrual cycling could expose patients who suffer from comorbidities or terminate a pregnancy, violating their privacy. We explore the application of Federated Learning (FL) to predict the optimal drug for patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a serious hormonal disorder impacting millions of women worldwide, yet it’s poorly understood and its research is stunted by a lack of patient data. We demonstrate that a variety of FL approaches succeed on a synthetic PCOS patient dataset. Our proposed FL models are a tool to access massive quantities of diverse data and identify the most effective treatment option while providing PCOS patients with privacy guarantees.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Multimodal data, which can comprehensively perceive and recognize the physical world, has become an essential path towards general artificial intelligence. However, multimodal large models trained on public datasets often underperform in specific industrial domains. This paper proposes a multimodal federated learning framework that enables multiple enterprises to utilize private domain data to collaboratively train large models for vertical domains, achieving intelligent services across scenarios. The authors discuss in-depth the strategic transformation of federated learning in terms of intelligence foundation and objectives in the era of big model, as well as the new challenges faced in heterogeneous data, model aggregation, performance and cost trade-off, data privacy, and incentive mechanism. The paper elaborates a case study of leading enterprises contributing multimodal data and expert knowledge to city safety operation management , including distributed deployment and efficient coordination of the federated learning platform, technical innovations on data quality improvement based on large model capabilities and efficient joint fine-tuning approaches. Preliminary experiments show that enterprises can enhance and accumulate intelligent capabilities through multimodal model federated learning, thereby jointly creating an smart city model that provides high-quality intelligent services covering energy infrastructure safety, residential community security, and urban operation management. The established federated learning cooperation ecosystem is expected to further aggregate industry, academia, and research resources, realize large models in multiple vertical domains, and promote the large-scale industrial application of artificial intelligence and cutting-edge research on multimodal federated learning.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Transformers have demonstrated tremendous success not only in the natural language processing (NLP) domain but also the field of computer vision, igniting various creative approaches and applications. Yet, the superior performance and modeling flexibility of transformers came with a severe increase in computation costs, and hence several works have proposed methods to reduce this burden. Inspired by a cost-cutting method originally proposed for language models, Data Multiplexing (DataMUX), we propose a novel approach for efficient visual recognition that employs additional dim1 batching (i.e., concatenation) that greatly improves the throughput with little compromise in the accuracy. We first introduce a naive adaptation of DataMux for vision models, Image Multiplexer, and devise novel components to overcome its weaknesses, rendering our final model, ConcatPlexer, at the sweet spot between inference speed and accuracy. The ConcatPlexer was trained on ImageNet1K and CIFAR100 dataset and it achieved 23.5% less GFLOPs than ViT-B&#x2F;16 with 69.5% and 83.4% validation accuracy, respectively.</p>

However, real-world multimodal datasets, such as healthcare data, are significantly more complex: each image (e.g. X-ray) is often paired with text (e.g. physician report) that describes many distinct attributes occurring in fine-grained regions of the image. We refer to these samples as exhibiting high pairwise complexity, since each image-text pair can be decomposed into a large number of region-attribute pairings. The extent to which VLMs can capture fine-grained relationships between image regions and textual attributes when trained on such data has not been previously evaluated. The first key contribution of this work is to demonstrate through systematic evaluations that as the pairwise complexity of the training dataset increases, standard VLMs struggle to learn region-attribute relationships, exhibiting performance degradations of up to 37% on retrieval tasks. In order to address this issue, we introduce ViLLA as our second key contribution. ViLLA, which is trained to capture fine-grained region-attribute relationships from complex datasets, involves two components: (a) a lightweight, self-supervised mapping model to decompose image-text samples into region-attribute pairs, and (b) a contrastive VLM to learn representations from generated region-attribute pairs. We demonstrate with experiments across four domains (synthetic, product, medical, and natural images) that ViLLA outperforms comparable VLMs on fine-grained reasoning tasks, such as zero-shot object detection (up to 3.6 AP50 points on COCO and 0.6 mAP points on LVIS) and retrieval (up to 14.2 R-Precision points).</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Error prediction in large language models often relies on domain-specific information. In this paper, we present measures for quantification of error in the response of a large language model based on the diversity of responses to a given prompt - hence independent of the underlying application. We describe how three such measures - based on entropy, Gini impurity, and centroid distance - can be employed. We perform a suite of experiments on multiple datasets and temperature settings to demonstrate that these measures strongly correlate with the probability of failure. Additionally, we present empirical results demonstrating how these measures can be applied to few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and error detection.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The goal of sequential recommendation (SR) is to predict a user’s potential interested items based on her&#x2F;his historical interaction sequences. Most existing sequential recommenders are developed based on ID features, which, despite their widespread use, often underperform with sparse IDs and struggle with the cold-start problem. Besides, inconsistent ID mappings hinder the model’s transferability, isolating similar recommendation domains that could have been co-optimized. This paper aims to address these issues by exploring the potential of multi-modal information in learning robust and generalizable sequence representations. We propose MISSRec, a multi-modal pre-training and transfer learning framework for SR. On the user side, we design a Transformer-based encoder-decoder model, where the contextual encoder learns to capture the sequence-level multi-modal synergy while a novel interest-aware decoder is developed to grasp item-modality-interest relations for better sequence representation. On the candidate item side, we adopt a dynamic fusion module to produce user-adaptive item representation, providing more precise matching between users and items. We pre-train the model with contrastive learning objectives and fine-tune it in an efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of MISSRec, promising an practical solution for real-world recommendation scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Impressive performance on point cloud semantic segmentation has been achieved by fully-supervised methods with large amounts of labelled data. As it is labour-intensive to acquire large-scale point cloud data with point-wise labels, many attempts have been made to explore learning 3D point cloud segmentation with limited annotations. Active learning is one of the effective strategies to achieve this purpose but is still under-explored. The most recent methods of this kind measure the uncertainty of each pre-divided region for manual labelling but they suffer from redundant information and require additional efforts for region division. This paper aims at addressing this issue by developing a hierarchical point-based active learning strategy. Specifically, we measure the uncertainty for each point by a hierarchical minimum margin uncertainty module which considers the contextual information at multiple levels. Then, a feature-distance suppression strategy is designed to select important and representative points for manual labelling. Besides, to better exploit the unlabelled data, we build a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on our active strategy. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNetV2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves 96.5% and 100% performance of fully-supervised baseline with only 0.07% and 0.1% training data, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art weakly-supervised and active learning methods.

<p>Abstract:<br>Neural force fields (NFFs) have gained prominence in computational chemistry as surrogate models, superseding quantum-chemistry calculations in ab initio molecular dynamics. The prevalent benchmark for NFFs has been the MD17 dataset and its subsequent extension. These datasets predominantly comprise geometries from the equilibrium region of the ground electronic state potential energy surface, sampling from direct adiabatic dynamics. However, many chemical reactions entail significant molecular deformations, notably bond breaking. We demonstrate the constrained distribution of internal coordinates and energies in the MD17 datasets, underscoring their inadequacy for representing systems undergoing chemical reactions. Addressing this sampling limitation, we introduce the xxMD (Extended Excited-state Molecular Dynamics) dataset, derived from non-adiabatic dynamics. This dataset encompasses energies and forces ascertained from both multireference wave function theory and density functional theory. Furthermore, its nuclear configuration spaces authentically depict chemical reactions, making xxMD a more chemically relevant dataset. Our re-assessment of equivariant models on the xxMD datasets reveals notably higher mean absolute errors than those reported for MD17 and its variants. This observation underscores the challenges faced in crafting a generalizable NFF model with extrapolation capability.

<p>Abstract:<br>The success of supervised deep learning models on cell recognition tasks relies on detailed annotations. Many previous works have managed to reduce the dependency on labels. However, considering the large number of cells contained in a patch, costly and inefficient labeling is still inevitable. To this end, we explored label-free methods for cell recognition. Prior self-activation maps (PSM) are proposed to generate pseudo masks as training targets. To be specific, an activation network is trained with self-supervised learning. The gradient information in the shallow layers of the network is aggregated to generate prior self-activation maps. Afterward, a semantic clustering module is then introduced as a pipeline to transform PSMs to pixel-level semantic pseudo masks for downstream tasks. We evaluated our method on two histological datasets: MoNuSeg (cell segmentation) and BCData (multi-class cell detection). Compared with other fully-supervised and weakly-supervised methods, our method can achieve competitive performance without any manual annotations. Our simple but effective framework can also achieve multi-class cell detection which can not be done by existing unsupervised methods. The results show the potential of PSMs that might inspire other research to deal with the hunger for labels in medical area.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>With large language models (LLMs) achieving remarkable breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP) domains, LLM-enhanced recommender systems have received much attention and have been actively explored currently. In this paper, we focus on adapting and empowering a pure large language model for zero-shot and few-shot recommendation tasks. First and foremost, we identify and formulate the lifelong sequential behavior incomprehension problem for LLMs in recommendation domains, i.e., LLMs fail to extract useful information from a textual context of long user behavior sequence, even if the length of context is far from reaching the context limitation of LLMs. To address such an issue and improve the recommendation performance of LLMs, we propose a novel framework, namely Retrieval-enhanced Large Language models (ReLLa) for recommendation tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. For zero-shot recommendation, we perform semantic user behavior retrieval (SUBR) to improve the data quality of testing samples, which greatly reduces the difficulty for LLMs to extract the essential knowledge from user behavior sequences. As for few-shot recommendation, we further design retrieval-enhanced instruction tuning (ReiT) by adopting SUBR as a data augmentation technique for training samples. Specifically, we develop a mixed training dataset consisting of both the original data samples and their retrieval-enhanced counterparts. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world public dataset (i.e., MovieLens-1M) to demonstrate the superiority of ReLLa compared with existing baseline models, as well as its capability for lifelong sequential behavior comprehension.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Graph transformers need strong inductive biases to derive meaningful attention scores. Yet, current proposals rarely address methods capturing longer ranges, hierarchical structures, or community structures, as they appear in various graphs such as molecules, social networks, and citation networks. In this paper, we propose a hierarchy-distance structural encoding (HDSE), which models a hierarchical distance between the nodes in a graph focusing on its multi-level, hierarchical nature. In particular, this yields a framework which can be flexibly integrated with existing graph transformers, allowing for simultaneous application with other positional representations. Through extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our HDSE method successfully enhances various types of baseline transformers, achieving state-of-the-art empirical performances on 10 benchmark datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The Automated Model Evaluation (AutoEval) framework entertains the possibility of evaluating a trained machine learning model without resorting to a labeled testing set. Despite the promise and some decent results, the existing AutoEval methods heavily rely on computing distribution shifts between the unlabelled testing set and the training set. We believe this reliance on the training set becomes another obstacle in shipping this technology to real-world ML development. In this work, we propose Contrastive Automatic Model Evaluation (CAME), a novel AutoEval framework that is rid of involving training set in the loop. The core idea of CAME bases on a theoretical analysis which bonds the model performance with a contrastive loss. Further, with extensive empirical validation, we manage to set up a predictable relationship between the two, simply by deducing on the unlabeled&#x2F;unseen testing set. The resulting framework CAME establishes a new SOTA results for AutoEval by surpassing prior work significantly.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Anonymity of both natural and legal persons in court rulings is a critical aspect of privacy protection in the European Union and Switzerland. With the advent of LLMs, concerns about large-scale re-identification of anonymized persons are growing. In accordance with the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland, we explore the potential of LLMs to re-identify individuals in court rulings by constructing a proof-of-concept using actual legal data from the Swiss federal supreme court. Following the initial experiment, we constructed an anonymized Wikipedia dataset as a more rigorous testing ground to further investigate the findings. With the introduction and application of the new task of re-identifying people in texts, we also introduce new metrics to measure performance. We systematically analyze the factors that influence successful re-identifications, identifying model size, input length, and instruction tuning among the most critical determinants. Despite high re-identification rates on Wikipedia, even the best LLMs struggled with court decisions. The complexity is attributed to the lack of test datasets, the necessity for substantial training resources, and data sparsity in the information used for re-identification. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that re-identification using LLMs may not be feasible for now, but as the proof-of-concept on Wikipedia showed, it might become possible in the future. We hope that our system can help enhance the confidence in the security of anonymized decisions, thus leading to the courts being more confident to publish decisions.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Automatic modulation classification (AMC) plays a critical role in wireless communications by autonomously classifying signals transmitted over the radio spectrum. Deep learning (DL) techniques are increasingly being used for AMC due to their ability to extract complex wireless signal features. However, DL models are computationally intensive and incur high inference latencies. This paper proposes the application of early exiting (EE) techniques for DL models used for AMC to accelerate inference. We present and analyze four early exiting architectures and a customized multi-branch training algorithm for this problem. Through extensive experimentation, we show that signals with moderate to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are easier to classify, do not require deep architectures, and can therefore leverage the proposed EE architectures. Our experimental results demonstrate that EE techniques can significantly reduce the inference speed of deep neural networks without sacrificing classification accuracy. We also thoroughly study the trade-off between classification accuracy and inference time when using these architectures. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first attempt to apply early exiting methods to AMC, providing a foundation for future research in this area.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We present an architecture and a training recipe that adapts pre-trained open-world image models to localization in videos. Understanding the open visual world (without being constrained by fixed label spaces) is crucial for many real-world vision tasks. Contrastive pre-training on large image-text datasets has recently led to significant improvements for image-level tasks. For more structured tasks involving object localization applying pre-trained models is more challenging. This is particularly true for video tasks, where task-specific data is limited. We show successful transfer of open-world models by building on the OWL-ViT open-vocabulary detection model and adapting it to video by adding a transformer decoder. The decoder propagates object representations recurrently through time by using the output tokens for one frame as the object queries for the next. Our model is end-to-end trainable on video data and enjoys improved temporal consistency compared to tracking-by-detection baselines, while retaining the open-world capabilities of the backbone detector. We evaluate our model on the challenging TAO-OW benchmark and demonstrate that open-world capabilities, learned from large-scale image-text pre-training, can be transferred successfully to open-world localization across diverse videos.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Efficiently obtaining the up-to-date information in the disaster-stricken area is the key to successful disaster response. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), workers and cars can collaborate to accomplish sensing tasks, such as data collection, in disaster-stricken areas. In this paper, we explicitly address the route planning for a group of agents, including UAVs, workers, and cars, with the goal of maximizing the task completion rate. We propose MANF-RL-RP, a heterogeneous multi-agent route planning algorithm that incorporates several efficient designs, including global-local dual information processing and a tailored model structure for heterogeneous multi-agent systems. Global-local dual information processing encompasses the extraction and dissemination of spatial features from global information, as well as the partitioning and filtering of local information from individual agents. Regarding the construction of the model structure for heterogeneous multi-agent, we perform the following work. We design the same data structure to represent the states of different agents, prove the Markovian property of the decision-making process of agents to simplify the model structure, and also design a reasonable reward function to train the model. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on the rich simulation data. In comparison to the baseline algorithms, namely Greedy-SC-RP and MANF-DNN-RP, MANF-RL-RP has exhibited a significant improvement in terms of task completion rate.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Multi-agent interactions, such as communication, teaching, and bluffing, often rely on higher-order social inference, i.e., understanding how others infer oneself. Such intricate reasoning can be effectively modeled through nested multi-agent reasoning. Nonetheless, the computational complexity escalates exponentially with each level of reasoning, posing a significant challenge. However, humans effortlessly perform complex social inferences as part of their daily lives. To bridge the gap between human-like inference capabilities and computational limitations, we propose a novel approach: leveraging neural networks to amortize high-order social inference, thereby expediting nested multi-agent reasoning. We evaluate our method in two challenging multi-agent interaction domains. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is computationally efficient while exhibiting minimal degradation in accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success in various applications including video action recognition, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks (Trojans). The backdoor-compromised model will mis-classify to the target class chosen by the attacker when a test instance (from a non-target class) is embedded with a specific trigger, while maintaining high accuracy on attack-free instances. Although there are extensive studies on backdoor attacks against image data, the susceptibility of video-based systems under backdoor attacks remains largely unexplored. Current studies are direct extensions of approaches proposed for image data, e.g., the triggers are \textbf{independently} embedded within the frames, which tend to be detectable by existing defenses. In this paper, we introduce a \textit{simple} yet \textit{effective} backdoor attack against video data. Our proposed attack, adding perturbations in a transformed domain, plants an \textbf{imperceptible, temporally distributed} trigger across the video frames, and is shown to be resilient to existing defensive strategies. The effectiveness of the proposed attack is demonstrated by extensive experiments with various well-known models on two video recognition benchmarks, UCF101 and HMDB51, and a sign language recognition benchmark, Greek Sign Language (GSL) dataset. We delve into the impact of several influential factors on our proposed attack and identify an intriguing effect termed “collateral damage” through extensive studies.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recently emerged Topological Deep Learning (TDL) methods aim to extend current Graph Neural Networks (GNN) by naturally processing higher-order interactions, going beyond the pairwise relations and local neighborhoods defined by graph representations. In this paper we propose a novel TDL-based method for compressing signals over graphs, consisting in two main steps: first, disjoint sets of higher-order structures are inferred based on the original signal –by clustering $N$ datapoints into $K\ll N$ collections; then, a topological-inspired message passing gets a compressed representation of the signal within those multi-element sets. Our results show that our framework improves both standard GNN and feed-forward architectures in compressing temporal link-based signals from two real-word Internet Service Provider Networks’ datasets –from $30%$ up to $90%$ better reconstruction errors across all evaluation scenarios–, suggesting that it better captures and exploits spatial and temporal correlations over the whole graph-based network structure.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Automation of High-Level Context (HLC) reasoning for intelligent systems at scale is imperative due to the unceasing accumulation of contextual data in the IoT era, the trend of the fusion of data from multi-sources, and the intrinsic complexity and dynamism of the context-based decision-making process. To mitigate this issue, we propose an automatic context reasoning framework CSM-H-R, which programmatically combines ontologies and states at runtime and the model-storage phase for attaining the ability to recognize meaningful HLC, and the resulting data representation can be applied to different reasoning techniques. Case studies are developed based on an intelligent elevator system in a smart campus setting. An implementation of the framework - a CSM Engine, and the experiments of translating the HLC reasoning into vector and matrix computing especially take care of the dynamic aspects of context and present the potentiality of using advanced mathematical and probabilistic models to achieve the next level of automation in integrating intelligent systems; meanwhile, privacy protection support is achieved by anonymization through label embedding and reducing information correlation.

<p>Abstract:<br>Recently, foundation models have exhibited remarkable advancements in multi-modal learning. These models, equipped with millions (or billions) of parameters, typically require a substantial amount of data for finetuning. However, collecting and centralizing training data from diverse sectors becomes challenging due to distinct privacy regulations. Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a promising solution, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively train neural networks without centralizing their local data. To alleviate client computation burdens and communication overheads, previous works have adapted Parameter-efficient Finetuning (PEFT) methods for FL. Hereby, only a small fraction of the model parameters are optimized and communicated during federated communications. Nevertheless, most previous works have focused on a single modality and neglected one common phenomenon, i.e., the presence of data heterogeneity across the clients. Therefore, in this work, we propose a finetuning framework tailored to heterogeneous multi-modal FL, called Federated Dual-Aadapter Teacher (FedDAT). Specifically, our approach leverages a Dual-Adapter Teacher (DAT) to address data heterogeneity by regularizing the client local updates and applying Mutual Knowledge Distillation (MKD) for an efficient knowledge transfer. FedDAT is the first approach that enables an efficient distributed finetuning of foundation models for a variety of heterogeneous Vision-Language tasks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on four multi-modality FL benchmarks with different types of data heterogeneity, where FedDAT substantially outperforms the existing centralized PEFT methods adapted for FL.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In recent years, several Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WS3) methods have been proposed that use class activation maps (CAMs) generated by a classifier to produce pseudo-ground truths for training segmentation models. While CAMs are good at highlighting discriminative regions (DR) of an image, they are known to disregard regions of the object that do not contribute to the classifier’s prediction, termed non-discriminative regions (NDR). In contrast, attribution methods such as saliency maps provide an alternative approach for assigning a score to every pixel based on its contribution to the classification prediction. This paper provides a comprehensive comparison between saliencies and CAMs for WS3. Our study includes multiple perspectives on understanding their similarities and dissimilarities. Moreover, we provide new evaluation metrics that perform a comprehensive assessment of WS3 performance of alternative methods w.r.t. CAMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of saliencies in addressing the limitation of CAMs through our empirical studies on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we propose random cropping as a stochastic aggregation technique that improves the performance of saliency, making it a strong alternative to CAM for WS3.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Clinical event sequences consist of hundreds of clinical events that represent records of patient care in time. Developing accurate predictive models of such sequences is of a great importance for supporting a variety of models for interpreting&#x2F;classifying the current patient condition, or predicting adverse clinical events and outcomes, all aimed to improve patient care. One important challenge of learning predictive models of clinical sequences is their patient-specific variability. Based on underlying clinical conditions, each patient’s sequence may consist of different sets of clinical events (observations, lab results, medications, procedures). Hence, simple population-wide models learned from event sequences for many different patients may not accurately predict patient-specific dynamics of event sequences and their differences. To address the problem, we propose and investigate multiple new event sequence prediction models and methods that let us better adjust the prediction for individual patients and their specific conditions. The methods developed in this work pursue refinement of population-wide models to subpopulations, self-adaptation, and a meta-level model switching that is able to adaptively select the model with the best chance to support the immediate prediction. We analyze and test the performance of these models on clinical event sequences of patients in MIMIC-III database.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Firm competition and collusion involve complex dynamics, particularly when considering communication among firms. Such issues can be modeled as problems of complex systems, traditionally approached through experiments involving human subjects or agent-based modeling methods. We propose an innovative framework called Smart Agent-Based Modeling (SABM), wherein smart agents, supported by GPT-4 technologies, represent firms, and interact with one another. We conducted a controlled experiment to study firm price competition and collusion behaviors under various conditions. SABM is more cost-effective and flexible compared to conducting experiments with human subjects. Smart agents possess an extensive knowledge base for decision-making and exhibit human-like strategic abilities, surpassing traditional ABM agents. Furthermore, smart agents can simulate human conversation and be personalized, making them ideal for studying complex situations involving communication. Our results demonstrate that, in the absence of communication, smart agents consistently reach tacit collusion, leading to prices converging at levels higher than the Bertrand equilibrium price but lower than monopoly or cartel prices. When communication is allowed, smart agents achieve a higher-level collusion with prices close to cartel prices. Collusion forms more quickly with communication, while price convergence is smoother without it. These results indicate that communication enhances trust between firms, encouraging frequent small price deviations to explore opportunities for a higher-level win-win situation and reducing the likelihood of triggering a price war. We also assigned different personas to firms to analyze behavioral differences and tested variant models under diverse market structures. The findings showcase the effectiveness and robustness of SABM and provide intriguing insights into competition and collusion.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We tackle the problem of learning complex, general behaviors directly in the real world. We propose an approach for robots to efficiently learn manipulation skills using only a handful of real-world interaction trajectories from many different settings. Inspired by the success of learning from large-scale datasets in the fields of computer vision and natural language, our belief is that in order to efficiently learn, a robot must be able to leverage internet-scale, human video data. Humans interact with the world in many interesting ways, which can allow a robot to not only build an understanding of useful actions and affordances but also how these actions affect the world for manipulation. Our approach builds a structured, human-centric action space grounded in visual affordances learned from human videos. Further, we train a world model on human videos and fine-tune on a small amount of robot interaction data without any task supervision. We show that this approach of affordance-space world models enables different robots to learn various manipulation skills in complex settings, in under 30 minutes of interaction.

<p>Abstract:<br>We introduce TADA, a simple-yet-effective approach that takes textual descriptions and produces expressive 3D avatars with high-quality geometry and lifelike textures, that can be animated and rendered with traditional graphics pipelines. Existing text-based character generation methods are limited in terms of geometry and texture quality, and cannot be realistically animated due to inconsistent alignment between the geometry and the texture, particularly in the face region. To overcome these limitations, TADA leverages the synergy of a 2D diffusion model and an animatable parametric body model. Specifically, we derive an optimizable high-resolution body model from SMPL-X with 3D displacements and a texture map, and use hierarchical rendering with score distillation sampling (SDS) to create high-quality, detailed, holistic 3D avatars from text. To ensure alignment between the geometry and texture, we render normals and RGB images of the generated character and exploit their latent embeddings in the SDS training process. We further introduce various expression parameters to deform the generated character during training, ensuring that the semantics of our generated character remain consistent with the original SMPL-X model, resulting in an animatable character. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that TADA significantly surpasses existing approaches on both qualitative and quantitative measures. TADA enables creation of large-scale digital character assets that are ready for animation and rendering, while also being easily editable through natural language. The code will be public for research purposes.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Modern large language models (LLMs) that rely on attention mechanisms are typically trained with fixed context lengths which enforce upper limits on the length of input sequences that they can handle at evaluation time. To use these models on sequences longer than the train-time context length, one might employ techniques from the growing family of context length extrapolation methods – most of which focus on modifying the system of positional encodings used in the attention mechanism to indicate where tokens or activations are located in the input sequence. We conduct a wide survey of existing methods of context length extrapolation on a base LLaMA or LLaMA 2 model, and introduce some of our own design as well – in particular, a new truncation strategy for modifying the basis for the position encoding.   We test these methods using three new evaluation tasks (FreeFormQA, AlteredNumericQA, and LongChat-Lines) as well as perplexity, which we find to be less fine-grained as a measure of long context performance of LLMs. We release the three tasks publicly as datasets on HuggingFace. We discover that linear scaling is the best method for extending context length, and show that further gains can be achieved by using longer scales at evaluation time. We also discover promising extrapolation capabilities in the truncated basis. To support further research in this area, we release three new 13B parameter long-context models which we call Giraffe: 4k and 16k context models trained from base LLaMA-13B, and a 32k context model trained from base LLaMA2-13B. We also release the code to replicate our results.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Transformer language models exhibit intelligent behaviors such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, acquiring knowledge, reasoning, planning, reflecting and using tools. This paper explores how their underlying mechanics give rise to intelligent behaviors. We adopt a systems approach to analyze Transformers in detail and develop a mathematical framework that frames their dynamics as movement through embedding space. This novel perspective provides a principled way of thinking about the problem and reveals important insights related to the emergence of intelligence:   1. At its core the Transformer is a Embedding Space walker, mapping intelligent behavior to trajectories in this vector space.   2. At each step of the walk, it composes context into a single composite vector whose location in Embedding Space defines the next step.   3. No learning actually occurs during decoding; in-context learning and generalization are simply the result of different contexts composing into different vectors.   4. Ultimately the knowledge, intelligence and skills exhibited by the model are embodied in the organization of vectors in Embedding Space rather than in specific neurons or layers. These abilities are properties of this organization.   5. Attention’s contribution boils down to the association-bias it lends to vector composition and which influences the aforementioned organization. However, more investigation is needed to ascertain its significance.   6. The entire model is composed from two principal operations: data independent filtering and data dependent aggregation. This generalization unifies Transformers with other sequence models and across modalities.   Building upon this foundation we formalize and test a semantic space theory which posits that embedding vectors represent semantic concepts and find some evidence of its validity.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The scarcity of task-labeled time-series benchmarks in the financial domain hinders progress in continual learning. Addressing this deficit would foster innovation in this area. Therefore, we present COB, Crude Oil Benchmark datasets. COB includes 30 years of asset prices that exhibit significant distribution shifts and optimally generates corresponding task (i.e., regime) labels based on these distribution shifts for the three most important crude oils in the world. Our contributions include creating real-world benchmark datasets by transforming asset price data into volatility proxies, fitting models using expectation-maximization (EM), generating contextual task labels that align with real-world events, and providing these labels as well as the general algorithm to the public. We show that the inclusion of these task labels universally improves performance on four continual learning algorithms, some state-of-the-art, over multiple forecasting horizons. We hope these benchmarks accelerate research in handling distribution shifts in real-world data, especially due to the global importance of the assets considered. We’ve made the (1) raw price data, (2) task labels generated by our approach, (3) and code for our algorithm available at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://oilpricebenchmarks.github.io/">https://oilpricebenchmarks.github.io</a>.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Despite the promising results of machine learning models in malware detection, they face the problem of concept drift due to malware constant evolution. This leads to a decline in performance over time, as the data distribution of the new files differs from the training one, requiring regular model update. In this work, we propose a model-agnostic protocol to improve a baseline neural network to handle with the drift problem. We show the importance of feature reduction and training with the most recent validation set possible, and propose a loss function named Drift-Resilient Binary Cross-Entropy, an improvement to the classical Binary Cross-Entropy more effective against drift. We train our model on the EMBER dataset (2018) and evaluate it on a dataset of recent malicious files, collected between 2020 and 2023. Our improved model shows promising results, detecting 15.2% more malware than a baseline model.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The field of multi-object tracking has recently seen a renewed interest in the good old schema of tracking-by-detection, as its simplicity and strong priors spare it from the complex design and painful babysitting of tracking-by-attention approaches. In view of this, we aim at extending tracking-by-detection to multi-modal settings, where a comprehensive cost has to be computed from heterogeneous information e.g., 2D motion cues, visual appearance, and pose estimates. More precisely, we follow a case study where a rough estimate of 3D information is also available and must be merged with other traditional metrics (e.g., the IoU). To achieve that, recent approaches resort to either simple rules or complex heuristics to balance the contribution of each cost. However, i) they require careful tuning of tailored hyperparameters on a hold-out set, and ii) they imply these costs to be independent, which does not hold in reality. We address these issues by building upon an elegant probabilistic formulation, which considers the cost of a candidate association as the negative log-likelihood yielded by a deep density estimator, trained to model the conditional joint probability distribution of correct associations. Our experiments, conducted on both simulated and real benchmarks, show that our approach consistently enhances the performance of several tracking-by-detection algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In recent years, vision transformers have been introduced into face recognition and analysis and have achieved performance breakthroughs. However, most previous methods generally train a single model or an ensemble of models to perform the desired task, which ignores the synergy among different tasks and fails to achieve improved prediction accuracy, increased data efficiency, and reduced training time. This paper presents a multi-purpose algorithm for simultaneous face recognition, facial expression recognition, age estimation, and face attribute estimation (40 attributes including gender) based on a single Swin Transformer. Our design, the SwinFace, consists of a single shared backbone together with a subnet for each set of related tasks. To address the conflicts among multiple tasks and meet the different demands of tasks, a Multi-Level Channel Attention (MLCA) module is integrated into each task-specific analysis subnet, which can adaptively select the features from optimal levels and channels to perform the desired tasks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model has a better understanding of the face and achieves excellent performance for all tasks. Especially, it achieves 90.97% accuracy on RAF-DB and 0.22 $\epsilon$-error on CLAP2015, which are state-of-the-art results on facial expression recognition and age estimation respectively.

<p>Abstract:<br>Recently, large-scale pre-trained vision-language models (e.g. CLIP and ALIGN) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in acquiring transferable visual representations. To leverage the valuable knowledge encoded within these models for downstream tasks, several fine-tuning approaches, including prompt tuning methods and adapter-based methods, have been developed to adapt vision-language models effectively with supervision. However, these methods rely on the availability of annotated samples, which can be labor-intensive and time-consuming to acquire, thus limiting scalability. To address this issue, in this work, we design an unsupervised fine-tuning approach for vision-language models called Unsupervised Prototype Adapter (UP-Adapter). Specifically, for the unannotated target datasets, we leverage the text-image aligning capability of CLIP to automatically select the most confident samples for each class. Utilizing these selected samples, we generate class prototypes, which serve as the initialization for the learnable prototype model. After fine-tuning, the prototype model prediction is combined with the original CLIP’s prediction by a residual connection to perform downstream recognition tasks. Our extensive experimental results on image recognition and domain generalization show that the proposed unsupervised method outperforms 8-shot CoOp, 8-shot Tip-Adapter, and also the state-of-the-art UPL method by large margins.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper studies co-segmenting the common semantic object in a set of images. Existing works either rely on carefully engineered networks to mine the implicit semantic information in visual features or require extra data (i.e., classification labels) for training. In this paper, we leverage the contrastive language-image pre-training framework (CLIP) for the task. With a backbone segmentation network that independently processes each image from the set, we introduce semantics from CLIP into the backbone features, refining them in a coarse-to-fine manner with three key modules: i) an image set feature correspondence module, encoding global consistent semantic information of the image set; ii) a CLIP interaction module, using CLIP-mined common semantics of the image set to refine the backbone feature; iii) a CLIP regularization module, drawing CLIP towards this co-segmentation task, identifying the best CLIP semantic and using it to regularize the backbone feature. Experiments on four standard co-segmentation benchmark datasets show that the performance of our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We are concerned with a challenging scenario in unpaired multiview video learning. In this case, the model aims to learn comprehensive multiview representations while the cross-view semantic information exhibits variations. We propose Semantics-based Unpaired Multiview Learning (SUM-L) to tackle this unpaired multiview learning problem. The key idea is to build cross-view pseudo-pairs and do view-invariant alignment by leveraging the semantic information of videos. To facilitate the data efficiency of multiview learning, we further perform video-text alignment for first-person and third-person videos, to fully leverage the semantic knowledge to improve video representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our framework. Our method also outperforms multiple existing view-alignment methods, under the more challenging scenario than typical paired or unpaired multimodal or multiview learning.

<p>Abstract:<br>Human actions in egocentric videos are often hand-object interactions composed from a verb (performed by the hand) applied to an object. Despite their extensive scaling up, egocentric datasets still face two limitations - sparsity of action compositions and a closed set of interacting objects. This paper proposes a novel open vocabulary action recognition task. Given a set of verbs and objects observed during training, the goal is to generalize the verbs to an open vocabulary of actions with seen and novel objects. To this end, we decouple the verb and object predictions via an object-agnostic verb encoder and a prompt-based object encoder. The prompting leverages CLIP representations to predict an open vocabulary of interacting objects. We create open vocabulary benchmarks on the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 and Assembly101 datasets; whereas closed-action methods fail to generalize, our proposed method is effective. In addition, our object encoder significantly outperforms existing open-vocabulary visual recognition methods in recognizing novel interacting objects.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Gait recognition is to seek correct matches for query individuals by their unique walking patterns at a long distance. However, current methods focus solely on individual gait features, disregarding inter-personal relationships. In this paper, we reconsider gait representation, asserting that gait is not just an aggregation of individual features, but also the relationships among different subjects’ gait features once reference gaits are established. From this perspective, we redefine classifier weights as reference-anchored gaits, allowing each person’s gait to be described by their relationship with these references. In our work, we call this novel descriptor Relationship Descriptor (RD). This Relationship Descriptor offers two benefits: emphasizing meaningful features and enhancing robustness. To be specific, The normalized dot product between gait features and classifier weights signifies a similarity relation, where each dimension indicates the similarity between the test sample and each training ID’s gait prototype, respectively. Despite its potential, the direct use of relationship descriptors poses dimensionality challenges since the dimension of RD depends on the training set’s identity count. To address this, we propose a Farthest Anchored gaits Selection algorithm and a dimension reduction method to boost gait recognition performance. Our method can be built on top of off-the-shelf pre-trained classification-based models without extra parameters. We show that RD achieves higher recognition performance than directly using extracted features. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on the popular GREW, Gait3D, CASIA-B, and OU-MVLP, showing that our method consistently outperforms the baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performances.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Given a query composed of a reference image and a relative caption, the Composed Image Retrieval goal is to retrieve images visually similar to the reference one that integrates the modifications expressed by the caption. Given that recent research has demonstrated the efficacy of large-scale vision and language pre-trained (VLP) models in various tasks, we rely on features from the OpenAI CLIP model to tackle the considered task. We initially perform a task-oriented fine-tuning of both CLIP encoders using the element-wise sum of visual and textual features. Then, in the second stage, we train a Combiner network that learns to combine the image-text features integrating the bimodal information and providing combined features used to perform the retrieval. We use contrastive learning in both stages of training. Starting from the bare CLIP features as a baseline, experimental results show that the task-oriented fine-tuning and the carefully crafted Combiner network are highly effective and outperform more complex state-of-the-art approaches on FashionIQ and CIRR, two popular and challenging datasets for composed image retrieval.

<p>Abstract:<br>Video-based ambient monitoring of gait for older adults with dementia has the potential to detect negative changes in health and allow clinicians and caregivers to intervene early to prevent falls or hospitalizations. Computer vision-based pose tracking models can process video data automatically and extract joint locations; however, publicly available models are not optimized for gait analysis on older adults or clinical populations. In this work we train a deep neural network to map from a two dimensional pose sequence, extracted from a video of an individual walking down a hallway toward a wall-mounted camera, to a set of three-dimensional spatiotemporal gait features averaged over the walking sequence. The data of individuals with dementia used in this work was captured at two sites using a wall-mounted system to collect the video and depth information used to train and evaluate our model. Our Pose2Gait model is able to extract velocity and step length values from the video that are correlated with the features from the depth camera, with Spearman’s correlation coefficients of .83 and .60 respectively, showing that three dimensional spatiotemporal features can be predicted from monocular video. Future work remains to improve the accuracy of other features, such as step time and step width, and test the utility of the predicted values for detecting meaningful changes in gait during longitudinal ambient monitoring.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The recent contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model has shown great success in a wide range of image-level tasks, revealing remarkable ability for learning powerful visual representations with rich semantics. An open and worthwhile problem is efficiently adapting such a strong model to the video domain and designing a robust video anomaly detector. In this work, we propose VadCLIP, a new paradigm for weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD) by leveraging the frozen CLIP model directly without any pre-training and fine-tuning process. Unlike current works that directly feed extracted features into the weakly supervised classifier for frame-level binary classification, VadCLIP makes full use of fine-grained associations between vision and language on the strength of CLIP and involves dual branch. One branch simply utilizes visual features for coarse-grained binary classification, while the other fully leverages the fine-grained language-image alignment. With the benefit of dual branch, VadCLIP achieves both coarse-grained and fine-grained video anomaly detection by transferring pre-trained knowledge from CLIP to WSVAD task. We conduct extensive experiments on two commonly-used benchmarks, demonstrating that VadCLIP achieves the best performance on both coarse-grained and fine-grained WSVAD, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Specifically, VadCLIP achieves 84.51% AP and 88.02% AUC on XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, respectively. Code and features will be released to facilitate future VAD research.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Improving the reliability of deployed machine learning systems often involves developing methods to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. However, existing research often narrowly focuses on samples from classes that are absent from the training set, neglecting other types of plausible distribution shifts. This limitation reduces the applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios, where systems encounter a wide variety of anomalous inputs. In this study, we categorize five distinct types of distribution shifts and critically evaluate the performance of recent OOD detection methods on each of them. We publicly release our benchmark under the name BROAD (Benchmarking Resilience Over Anomaly Diversity). Our findings reveal that while these methods excel in detecting unknown classes, their performance is inconsistent when encountering other types of distribution shifts. In other words, they only reliably detect unexpected inputs that they have been specifically designed to expect. As a first step toward broad OOD detection, we learn a generative model of existing detection scores with a Gaussian mixture. By doing so, we present an ensemble approach that offers a more consistent and comprehensive solution for broad OOD detection, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. Our code to download BROAD and reproduce our experiments is publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recent strides in Text-to-3D techniques have been propelled by distilling knowledge from powerful large text-to-image diffusion models (LDMs). Nonetheless, existing Text-to-3D approaches often grapple with challenges such as over-saturation, inadequate detailing, and unrealistic outputs. This study presents a novel strategy that leverages explicitly synthesized multi-view images to address these issues. Our approach involves the utilization of image-to-image pipelines, empowered by LDMs, to generate posed high-quality images based on the renderings of coarse 3D models. Although the generated images mostly alleviate the aforementioned issues, challenges such as view inconsistency and significant content variance persist due to the inherent generative nature of large diffusion models, posing extensive difficulties in leveraging these images effectively. To overcome this hurdle, we advocate integrating a discriminator alongside a novel Diffusion-GAN dual training strategy to guide the training of 3D models. For the incorporated discriminator, the synthesized multi-view images are considered real data, while the renderings of the optimized 3D models function as fake data. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over baseline approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This work targets what we consider to be the foundational step for urban airborne robots, a safe landing. Our attention is directed toward what we deem the most crucial aspect of the safe landing perception stack: segmentation. We present a streamlined reactive UAV system that employs visual servoing by harnessing the capabilities of open vocabulary image segmentation. This approach can adapt to various scenarios with minimal adjustments, bypassing the necessity for extensive data accumulation for refining internal models, thanks to its open vocabulary methodology. Given the limitations imposed by local authorities, our primary focus centers on operations originating from altitudes of 100 meters. This choice is deliberate, as numerous preceding works have dealt with altitudes up to 30 meters, aligning with the capabilities of small stereo cameras. Consequently, we leave the remaining 20m to be navigated using conventional 3D path planning methods. Utilizing monocular cameras and image segmentation, our findings demonstrate the system’s capability to successfully execute landing maneuvers at altitudes as low as 20 meters. However, this approach is vulnerable to intermittent and occasionally abrupt fluctuations in the segmentation between frames in a video stream. To address this challenge, we enhance the image segmentation output by introducing what we call a dynamic focus: a masking mechanism that self adjusts according to the current landing stage. This dynamic focus guides the control system to avoid regions beyond the drone’s safety radius projected onto the ground, thus mitigating the problems with fluctuations. Through the implementation of this supplementary layer, our experiments have reached improvements in the landing success rate of almost tenfold when compared to global segmentation. All the source code is open source and available online (github.com&#x2F;MISTLab&#x2F;DOVESEI).</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to build classification models from data streams. At each step of the CIL process, new classes must be integrated into the model. Due to catastrophic forgetting, CIL is particularly challenging when examples from past classes cannot be stored, the case on which we focus here. To date, most approaches are based exclusively on the target dataset of the CIL process. However, the use of models pre-trained in a self-supervised way on large amounts of data has recently gained momentum. The initial model of the CIL process may only use the first batch of the target dataset, or also use pre-trained weights obtained on an auxiliary dataset. The choice between these two initial learning strategies can significantly influence the performance of the incremental learning model, but has not yet been studied in depth. Performance is also influenced by the choice of the CIL algorithm, the neural architecture, the nature of the target task, the distribution of classes in the stream and the number of examples available for learning. We conduct a comprehensive experimental study to assess the roles of these factors. We present a statistical analysis framework that quantifies the relative contribution of each factor to incremental performance. Our main finding is that the initial training strategy is the dominant factor influencing the average incremental accuracy, but that the choice of CIL algorithm is more important in preventing forgetting. Based on this analysis, we propose practical recommendations for choosing the right initial training strategy for a given incremental learning use case. These recommendations are intended to facilitate the practical deployment of incremental learning.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The demand for accurate food quantification has increased in the recent years, driven by the needs of applications in dietary monitoring. At the same time, computer vision approaches have exhibited great potential in automating tasks within the food domain. Traditionally, the development of machine learning models for these problems relies on training data sets with pixel-level class annotations. However, this approach introduces challenges arising from data collection and ground truth generation that quickly become costly and error-prone since they must be performed in multiple settings and for thousands of classes. To overcome these challenges, the paper presents a weakly supervised methodology for training food image classification and semantic segmentation models without relying on pixel-level annotations. The proposed methodology is based on a multiple instance learning approach in combination with an attention-based mechanism. At test time, the models are used for classification and, concurrently, the attention mechanism generates semantic heat maps which are used for food class segmentation. In the paper, we conduct experiments on two meta-classes within the FoodSeg103 data set to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach and we explore the functioning properties of the attention mechanism.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Maintaining high efficiency and high precision are two fundamental challenges in UAV tracking due to the constraints of computing resources, battery capacity, and UAV maximum load. Discriminative correlation filters (DCF)-based trackers can yield high efficiency on a single CPU but with inferior precision. Lightweight Deep learning (DL)-based trackers can achieve a good balance between efficiency and precision but performance gains are limited by the compression rate. High compression rate often leads to poor discriminative representations. To this end, this paper aims to enhance the discriminative power of feature representations from a new feature-learning perspective. Specifically, we attempt to learn more disciminative representations with contrastive instances for UAV tracking in a simple yet effective manner, which not only requires no manual annotations but also allows for developing and deploying a lightweight model. We are the first to explore contrastive learning for UAV tracking. Extensive experiments on four UAV benchmarks, including UAV123@10fps, DTB70, UAVDT and VisDrone2018, show that the proposed DRCI tracker significantly outperforms state-of-the-art UAV tracking methods.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Self-supervised pretraining (SSP) has emerged as a popular technique in machine learning, enabling the extraction of meaningful feature representations without labelled data. In the realm of computer vision, pretrained vision transformers (ViTs) have played a pivotal role in advancing transfer learning. Nonetheless, the escalating cost of finetuning these large models has posed a challenge due to the explosion of model size. This study endeavours to evaluate the effectiveness of pure self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques in computer vision tasks, obviating the need for finetuning, with the intention of emulating human-like capabilities in generalisation and recognition of unseen objects. To this end, we propose an evaluation protocol for zero-shot segmentation based on a prompting patch. Given a point on the target object as a prompt, the algorithm calculates the similarity map between the selected patch and other patches, upon that, a simple thresholding is applied to segment the target. Another evaluation is intra-object and inter-object similarity to gauge discriminatory ability of SSP ViTs. Insights from zero-shot segmentation from prompting and discriminatory abilities of SSP led to the design of a simple SSP approach, termed MMC. This approaches combines Masked image modelling for encouraging similarity of local features, Momentum based self-distillation for transferring semantics from global to local features, and global Contrast for promoting semantics of global features, to enhance discriminative representations of SSP ViTs. Consequently, our proposed method significantly reduces the overlap of intra-object and inter-object similarities, thereby facilitating effective object segmentation within an image. Our experiments reveal that MMC delivers top-tier results in zero-shot semantic segmentation across various datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Fast Adversarial Training (FAT) not only improves the model robustness but also reduces the training cost of standard adversarial training. However, fast adversarial training often suffers from Catastrophic Overfitting (CO), which results in poor robustness performance. Catastrophic Overfitting describes the phenomenon of a sudden and significant decrease in robust accuracy during the training of fast adversarial training. Many effective techniques have been developed to prevent Catastrophic Overfitting and improve the model robustness from different perspectives. However, these techniques adopt inconsistent training settings and require different training costs, i.e, training time and memory costs, leading to unfair comparisons. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of over 10 fast adversarial training methods in terms of adversarial robustness and training costs. We revisit the effectiveness and efficiency of fast adversarial training techniques in preventing Catastrophic Overfitting from the perspective of model local nonlinearity and propose an effective Lipschitz regularization method for fast adversarial training. Furthermore, we explore the effect of data augmentation and weight averaging in fast adversarial training and propose a simple yet effective auto weight averaging method to improve robustness further. By assembling these techniques, we propose a FGSM-based fast adversarial training method equipped with Lipschitz regularization and Auto Weight averaging, abbreviated as FGSM-LAW. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark databases demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art fast adversarial training methods and the advanced standard adversarial training methods.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Face Recognition Systems (FRS) are vulnerable to morph attacks. A face morph is created by combining multiple identities with the intention to fool FRS and making it match the morph with multiple identities. Current Morph Attack Detection (MAD) can detect the morph but are unable to recover the identities used to create the morph with satisfactory outcomes. Existing work in de-morphing is mostly reference-based, i.e. they require the availability of one identity to recover the other. Sudipta et al. \cite{ref9} proposed a reference-free de-morphing technique but the visual realism of outputs produced were feeble. In this work, we propose SDeMorph (Stably Diffused De-morpher), a novel de-morphing method that is reference-free and recovers the identities of bona fides. Our method produces feature-rich outputs that are of significantly high quality in terms of definition and facial fidelity. Our method utilizes Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) by destroying the input morphed signal and then reconstructing it back using a branched-UNet. Experiments on ASML, FRLL-FaceMorph, FRLL-MorDIFF, and SMDD datasets support the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Latest methods represent shapes with open surfaces using unsigned distance functions (UDFs). They train neural networks to learn UDFs and reconstruct surfaces with the gradients around the zero level set of the UDF. However, the differential networks struggle from learning the zero level set where the UDF is not differentiable, which leads to large errors on unsigned distances and gradients around the zero level set, resulting in highly fragmented and discontinuous surfaces. To resolve this problem, we propose to learn a more continuous zero level set in UDFs with level set projections. Our insight is to guide the learning of zero level set using the rest non-zero level sets via a projection procedure. Our idea is inspired from the observations that the non-zero level sets are much smoother and more continuous than the zero level set. We pull the non-zero level sets onto the zero level set with gradient constraints which align gradients over different level sets and correct unsigned distance errors on the zero level set, leading to a smoother and more continuous unsigned distance field. We conduct comprehensive experiments in surface reconstruction for point clouds, real scans or depth maps, and further explore the performance in unsupervised point cloud upsampling and unsupervised point normal estimation with the learned UDF, which demonstrate our non-trivial improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Abstract:<br>Existing kinematic skeleton-based 3D human pose estimation methods only predict joint positions. Although this is sufficient to compute the yaw and pitch of the bone rotations, the roll around the axis of the bones remains unresolved by these methods. In this paper, we propose a novel 2D-to-3D lifting Graph Convolution Network named PoseGraphNet++ to predict the complete human pose including the joint positions and the bone orientations. We employ node and edge convolutions to utilize the joint and bone features. Our model is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, and its performance is either on par with or better than the state-of-the-art in terms of both position and rotation metrics. Through extensive ablation studies, we show that PoseGraphNet++ benefits from exploiting the mutual relationship between the joints and the bones.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Vision transformers have shown unprecedented levels of performance in tackling various visual perception tasks in recent years. However, the architectural and computational complexity of such network architectures have made them challenging to deploy in real-world applications with high-throughput, low-memory requirements. As such, there has been significant research recently on the design of efficient vision transformer architectures. In this study, we explore the generation of fast vision transformer architecture designs via generative architecture search (GAS) to achieve a strong balance between accuracy and architectural and computational efficiency. Through this generative architecture search process, we create TurboViT, a highly efficient hierarchical vision transformer architecture design that is generated around mask unit attention and Q-pooling design patterns. The resulting TurboViT architecture design achieves significantly lower architectural computational complexity (&gt;2.47$\times$ smaller than FasterViT-0 while achieving same accuracy) and computational complexity (&gt;3.4$\times$ fewer FLOPs and 0.9% higher accuracy than MobileViT2-2.0) when compared to 10 other state-of-the-art efficient vision transformer network architecture designs within a similar range of accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset. Furthermore, TurboViT demonstrated strong inference latency and throughput in both low-latency and batch processing scenarios (&gt;3.21$\times$ lower latency and &gt;3.18$\times$ higher throughput compared to FasterViT-0 for low-latency scenario). These promising results demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging generative architecture search for generating efficient transformer architecture designs for high-throughput scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We present ScanNet++, a large-scale dataset that couples together capture of high-quality and commodity-level geometry and color of indoor scenes. Each scene is captured with a high-end laser scanner at sub-millimeter resolution, along with registered 33-megapixel images from a DSLR camera, and RGB-D streams from an iPhone. Scene reconstructions are further annotated with an open vocabulary of semantics, with label-ambiguous scenarios explicitly annotated for comprehensive semantic understanding. ScanNet++ enables a new real-world benchmark for novel view synthesis, both from high-quality RGB capture, and importantly also from commodity-level images, in addition to a new benchmark for 3D semantic scene understanding that comprehensively encapsulates diverse and ambiguous semantic labeling scenarios. Currently, ScanNet++ contains 460 scenes, 280,000 captured DSLR images, and over 3.7M iPhone RGBD frames.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Creating high quality and realistic materials in computer graphics is a challenging and time-consuming task, which requires great expertise. In this paper, we present MatFuse, a novel unified approach that harnesses the generative power of diffusion models (DM) to simplify the creation of SVBRDF maps. Our DM-based pipeline integrates multiple sources of conditioning, such as color palettes, sketches, and pictures, enabling fine-grained control and flexibility in material synthesis. This design allows for the combination of diverse information sources (e.g., sketch + image embedding), enhancing creative possibilities in line with the principle of compositionality. We demonstrate the generative capabilities of the proposed method under various conditioning settings; on the SVBRDF estimation task, we show that our method yields performance comparable to state-of-the-art approaches, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We address the problem of learning Deep Learning Radiomics (DLR) that are not redundant with Hand-Crafted Radiomics (HCR). To do so, we extract DLR features using a VAE while enforcing their independence with HCR features by minimizing their mutual information. The resulting DLR features can be combined with hand-crafted ones and leveraged by a classifier to predict early markers of cancer. We illustrate our method on four early markers of pancreatic cancer and validate it on a large independent test set. Our results highlight the value of combining non-redundant DLR and HCR features, as evidenced by an improvement in the Area Under the Curve compared to baseline methods that do not address redundancy or solely rely on HCR features.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The development of fair and ethical AI systems requires careful consideration of bias mitigation, an area often overlooked or ignored. In this study, we introduce a novel and efficient approach for addressing biases called Targeted Data Augmentation (TDA), which leverages classical data augmentation techniques to tackle the pressing issue of bias in data and models. Unlike the laborious task of removing biases, our method proposes to insert biases instead, resulting in improved performance. To identify biases, we annotated two diverse datasets: a dataset of clinical skin lesions and a dataset of male and female faces. These bias annotations are published for the first time in this study, providing a valuable resource for future research. Through Counterfactual Bias Insertion, we discovered that biases associated with the frame, ruler, and glasses had a significant impact on models. By randomly introducing biases during training, we mitigated these biases and achieved a substantial decrease in bias measures, ranging from two-fold to more than 50-fold, while maintaining a negligible increase in the error rate.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Rail detection is one of the key factors for intelligent train. In the paper, motivated by the anchor line-based lane detection methods, we propose a rail detection network called DALNet based on dynamic anchor line. Aiming to solve the problem that the predefined anchor line is image agnostic, we design a novel dynamic anchor line mechanism. It utilizes a dynamic anchor line generator to dynamically generate an appropriate anchor line for each rail instance based on the position and shape of the rails in the input image. These dynamically generated anchor lines can be considered as better position references to accurately localize the rails than the predefined anchor lines. In addition, we present a challenging urban rail detection dataset DL-Rail with high-quality annotations and scenario diversity. DL-Rail contains 7000 pairs of images and annotations along with scene tags, and it is expected to encourage the development of rail detection. We extensively compare DALNet with many competitive lane methods. The results show that our DALNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on our DL-Rail rail detection dataset and the popular Tusimple and LLAMAS lane detection benchmarks.

<p>Abstract:<br>We propose Boundary-RL, a novel weakly supervised segmentation method that utilises only patch-level labels for training. We envision the segmentation as a boundary detection problem, rather than a pixel-level classification as in previous works. This outlook on segmentation may allow for boundary delineation under challenging scenarios such as where noise artefacts may be present within the region-of-interest (ROI) boundaries, where traditional pixel-level classification-based weakly supervised methods may not be able to effectively segment the ROI. Particularly of interest, ultrasound images, where intensity values represent acoustic impedance differences between boundaries, may also benefit from the boundary delineation approach. Our method uses reinforcement learning to train a controller function to localise boundaries of ROIs using a reward derived from a pre-trained boundary-presence classifier. The classifier indicates when an object boundary is encountered within a patch, as the controller modifies the patch location in a sequential Markov decision process. The classifier itself is trained using only binary patch-level labels of object presence, which are the only labels used during training of the entire boundary delineation framework, and serves as a weak signal to inform the boundary delineation. The use of a controller function ensures that a sliding window over the entire image is not necessary. It also prevents possible false-positive or -negative cases by minimising number of patches passed to the boundary-presence classifier. We evaluate our proposed approach for a clinically relevant task of prostate gland segmentation on trans-rectal ultrasound images. We show improved performance compared to other tested weakly supervised methods, using the same labels e.g., multiple instance learning.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Object-centric representations using slots have shown the advances towards efficient, flexible and interpretable abstraction from low-level perceptual features in a compositional scene. Current approaches randomize the initial state of slots followed by an iterative refinement. As we show in this paper, the random slot initialization significantly affects the accuracy of the final slot prediction. Moreover, current approaches require a predetermined number of slots from prior knowledge of the data, which limits the applicability in the real world. In our work, we initialize the slot representations with clustering algorithms conditioned on the perceptual input features. This requires an additional layer in the architecture to initialize the slots given the identified clusters. We design permutation invariant and permutation equivariant versions of this layer to enable the exchangeable slot representations after clustering. Additionally, we employ mean-shift clustering to automatically identify the number of slots for a given scene. We evaluate our method on object discovery and novel view synthesis tasks with various datasets. The results show that our method outperforms prior works consistently, especially for complex scenes.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Super-resolution (SR) networks have been investigated for a while, with their mobile and lightweight versions gaining noticeable popularity recently. Quantization, the procedure of decreasing the precision of network parameters (mostly FP32 to INT8), is also utilized in SR networks for establishing mobile compatibility. This study focuses on a very important but mostly overlooked post-training quantization (PTQ) step: representative dataset (RD), which adjusts the quantization range for PTQ. We propose a novel pipeline (clip-free quantization pipeline, CFQP) backed up with extensive experimental justifications to cleverly augment RD images by only using outputs of the FP32 model. Using the proposed pipeline for RD, we can successfully eliminate unwanted clipped activation layers, which nearly all mobile SR methods utilize to make the model more robust to PTQ in return for a large overhead in runtime. Removing clipped activations with our method significantly benefits overall increased stability, decreased inference runtime up to 54% on some SR models, better visual quality results compared to INT8 clipped models - and outperforms even some FP32 non-quantized models, both in runtime and visual quality, without the need for retraining with clipped activation.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Modeling long-term context in videos is crucial for many fine-grained tasks including temporal action segmentation. An interesting question that is still open is how much long-term temporal context is needed for optimal performance. While transformers can model the long-term context of a video, this becomes computationally prohibitive for long videos. Recent works on temporal action segmentation thus combine temporal convolutional networks with self-attentions that are computed only for a local temporal window. While these approaches show good results, their performance is limited by their inability to capture the full context of a video. In this work, we try to answer how much long-term temporal context is required for temporal action segmentation by introducing a transformer-based model that leverages sparse attention to capture the full context of a video. We compare our model with the current state of the art on three datasets for temporal action segmentation, namely 50Salads, Breakfast, and Assembly101. Our experiments show that modeling the full context of a video is necessary to obtain the best performance for temporal action segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Continual Learning (CL) involves training a machine learning model in a sequential manner to learn new information while retaining previously learned tasks without the presence of previous training data. Although there has been significant interest in CL, most recent CL approaches in computer vision have focused on convolutional architectures only. However, with the recent success of vision transformers, there is a need to explore their potential for CL. Although there have been some recent CL approaches for vision transformers, they either store training instances of previous tasks or require a task identifier during test time, which can be limiting. This paper proposes a new exemplar-free approach for class&#x2F;task incremental learning called ConTraCon, which does not require task-id to be explicitly present during inference and avoids the need for storing previous training instances. The proposed approach leverages the transformer architecture and involves re-weighting the key, query, and value weights of the multi-head self-attention layers of a transformer trained on a similar task. The re-weighting is done using convolution, which enables the approach to maintain low parameter requirements per task. Additionally, an image augmentation-based entropic task identification approach is used to predict tasks without requiring task-ids during inference. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms several competitive approaches while requiring fewer parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Collecting diverse sets of training images for RGB-D semantic image segmentation is not always possible. In particular, when robots need to operate in privacy-sensitive areas like homes, the collection is often limited to a small set of locations. As a consequence, the annotated images lack diversity in appearance and approaches for RGB-D semantic image segmentation tend to overfit the training data. In this paper, we thus introduce semantic RGB-D image synthesis to address this problem. It requires synthesising a realistic-looking RGB-D image for a given semantic label map. Current approaches, however, are uni-modal and cannot cope with multi-modal data. Indeed, we show that extending uni-modal approaches to multi-modal data does not perform well. In this paper, we therefore propose a generator for multi-modal data that separates modal-independent information of the semantic layout from the modal-dependent information that is needed to generate an RGB and a depth image, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a discriminator that ensures semantic consistency between the label maps and the generated images and perceptual similarity between the real and generated images. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous uni-modal methods by a large margin and that the accuracy of an approach for RGB-D semantic segmentation can be significantly improved by mixing real and generated images during training.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In this study, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical data are both considered for Earth surface classification. Specifically, the integration of Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data is carried out through supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms implemented on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for the classification of a particular region of interest. Achieved results demonstrate how in this case radar and optical remote detection provide complementary information, benefiting surface cover classification and generally leading to increased mapping accuracy. In addition, this paper works in the direction of proving the emerging role of GEE as an effective cloud-based tool for handling large amounts of satellite data.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Cross-modal pre-training has shown impressive performance on a wide range of downstream tasks, benefiting from massive image-text pairs collected from the Internet. In practice, online data are growing constantly, highlighting the importance of the ability of pre-trained model to learn from data that is continuously growing. Existing works on cross-modal pre-training mainly focus on training a network with fixed architecture. However, it is impractical to limit the model capacity when considering the continuously growing nature of pre-training data in real-world applications. On the other hand, it is important to utilize the knowledge in the current model to obtain efficient training and better performance. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose GrowCLIP, a data-driven automatic model growing algorithm for contrastive language-image pre-training with continuous image-text pairs as input. Specially, we adopt a dynamic growth space and seek out the optimal architecture at each growth step to adapt to online learning scenarios. And the shared encoder is proposed in our growth space to enhance the degree of cross-modal fusion. Besides, we explore the effect of growth in different dimensions, which could provide future references for the design of cross-modal model architecture. Finally, we employ parameter inheriting with momentum (PIM) to maintain the previous knowledge and address the issue of the local minimum dilemma. Compared with the existing methods, GrowCLIP improves 2.3% average top-1 accuracy on zero-shot image classification of 9 downstream tasks. As for zero-shot image retrieval, GrowCLIP can improve 1.2% for top-1 image-to-text recall on Flickr30K dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Current video object detection (VOD) models often encounter issues with over-aggregation due to redundant aggregation strategies, which perform feature aggregation on every frame. This results in suboptimal performance and increased computational complexity. In this work, we propose an image-level Object Detection Difficulty (ODD) metric to quantify the difficulty of detecting objects in a given image. The derived ODD scores can be used in the VOD process to mitigate over-aggregation. Specifically, we train an ODD predictor as an auxiliary head of a still-image object detector to compute the ODD score for each image based on the discrepancies between detection results and ground-truth bounding boxes. The ODD score enhances the VOD system in two ways: 1) it enables the VOD system to select superior global reference frames, thereby improving overall accuracy; and 2) it serves as an indicator in the newly designed ODD Scheduler to eliminate the aggregation of frames that are easy to detect, thus accelerating the VOD process. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that, when utilized for selecting global reference frames, ODD-VOD consistently enhances the accuracy of Global-frame-based VOD models. When employed for acceleration, ODD-VOD consistently improves the frames per second (FPS) by an average of 73.3% across 8 different VOD models without sacrificing accuracy. When combined, ODD-VOD attains state-of-the-art performance when competing with many VOD methods in both accuracy and speed. Our work represents a significant advancement towards making VOD more practical for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Existing visual tracking methods typically take an image patch as the reference of the target to perform tracking. However, a single image patch cannot provide a complete and precise concept of the target object as images are limited in their ability to abstract and can be ambiguous, which makes it difficult to track targets with drastic variations. In this paper, we propose the CiteTracker to enhance target modeling and inference in visual tracking by connecting images and text. Specifically, we develop a text generation module to convert the target image patch into a descriptive text containing its class and attribute information, providing a comprehensive reference point for the target. In addition, a dynamic description module is designed to adapt to target variations for more effective target representation. We then associate the target description and the search image using an attention-based correlation module to generate the correlated features for target state reference. Extensive experiments on five diverse datasets are conducted to evaluate the proposed algorithm and the favorable performance against the state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed tracking method.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In this paper we show how Group Equivariant Convolutional Neural Networks use subsampling to learn to break equivariance to their symmetries. We focus on 2D rotations and reflections and investigate the impact of broken equivariance on network performance. We show that a change in the input dimension of a network as small as a single pixel can be enough for commonly used architectures to become approximately equivariant, rather than exactly. We investigate the impact of networks not being exactly equivariant and find that approximately equivariant networks generalise significantly worse to unseen symmetries compared to their exactly equivariant counterparts. However, when the symmetries in the training data are not identical to the symmetries of the network, we find that approximately equivariant networks are able to relax their own equivariant constraints, causing them to match or outperform exactly equivariant networks on common benchmark datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Humans effortlessly infer the 3D shape of objects. What computations underlie this ability? Although various computational models have been proposed, none of them capture the human ability to match object shape across viewpoints. Here, we ask whether and how this gap might be closed. We begin with a relatively novel class of computational models, 3D neural fields, which encapsulate the basic principles of classic analysis-by-synthesis in a deep neural network (DNN). First, we find that a 3D Light Field Network (3D-LFN) supports 3D matching judgments well aligned to humans for within-category comparisons, adversarially-defined comparisons that accentuate the 3D failure cases of standard DNN models, and adversarially-defined comparisons for algorithmically generated shapes with no category structure. We then investigate the source of the 3D-LFN’s ability to achieve human-aligned performance through a series of computational experiments. Exposure to multiple viewpoints of objects during training and a multi-view learning objective are the primary factors behind model-human alignment; even conventional DNN architectures come much closer to human behavior when trained with multi-view objectives. Finally, we find that while the models trained with multi-view learning objectives are able to partially generalize to new object categories, they fall short of human alignment. This work provides a foundation for understanding human shape inferences within neurally mappable computational architectures and highlights important questions for future work.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a pathological condition characterized by bleeding inside the skull or brain, which can be attributed to various factors. Identifying, localizing and quantifying ICH has important clinical implications, in a bleed-dependent manner. While deep learning techniques are widely used in medical image segmentation and have been applied to the ICH segmentation task, existing public ICH datasets do not support the multi-class segmentation problem. To address this, we develop the Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD), which provides a 3D multi-class ICH dataset containing 192 volumes with pixel-level annotations and 2200 volumes with slice-level annotations across five categories of ICH. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we formulate a series of supervised and semi-supervised ICH segmentation tasks. We provide experimental results with state-of-the-art models as reference benchmarks for further model developments and evaluations on this dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The quality of a wood log in the wood industry depends heavily on the presence of both outer and inner defects, including inner knots that are a result of the growth of tree branches. Today, locating the inner knots require the use of expensive equipment such as X-ray scanners. In this paper, we address the task of predicting the location of inner defects from the outer shape of the logs. The dataset is built by extracting both the contours and the knots with X-ray measurements. We propose to solve this binary segmentation task by leveraging convolutional recurrent neural networks. Once the neural network is trained, inference can be performed from the outer shape measured with cheap devices such as laser profilers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on fir and spruce tree species and perform ablation on the recurrence to demonstrate its importance.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>T1 mapping is a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) technique that has emerged as a valuable tool in the diagnosis of diffuse myocardial diseases. However, prevailing approaches have relied heavily on breath-hold sequences to eliminate respiratory motion artifacts. This limitation hinders accessibility and effectiveness for patients who cannot tolerate breath-holding. Image registration can be used to enable free-breathing T1 mapping. Yet, inherent intensity differences between the different time points make the registration task challenging. We introduce PCMC-T1, a physically-constrained deep-learning model for motion correction in free-breathing T1 mapping. We incorporate the signal decay model into the network architecture to encourage physically-plausible deformations along the longitudinal relaxation axis. We compared PCMC-T1 to baseline deep-learning-based image registration approaches using a 5-fold experimental setup on a publicly available dataset of 210 patients. PCMC-T1 demonstrated superior model fitting quality (R2: 0.955) and achieved the highest clinical impact (clinical score: 3.93) compared to baseline methods (0.941, 0.946 and 3.34, 3.62 respectively). Anatomical alignment results were comparable (Dice score: 0.9835 vs. 0.984, 0.988).

<p>Abstract:<br>Motivated by the challenges of the Digital Ancient Near Eastern Studies (DANES) community, we develop digital tools for processing cuneiform script being a 3D script imprinted into clay tablets used for more than three millennia and at least eight major languages. It consists of thousands of characters that have changed over time and space. Photographs are the most common representations usable for machine learning, while ink drawings are prone to interpretation. Best suited 3D datasets that are becoming available. We created and used the HeiCuBeDa and MaiCuBeDa datasets, which consist of around 500 annotated tablets. For our novel OCR-like approach to mixed image data, we provide an additional mapping tool for transferring annotations between 3D renderings and photographs. Our sign localization uses a RepPoints detector to predict the locations of characters as bounding boxes. We use image data from GigaMesh’s MSII (curvature, see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gigamesh.eu/">https://gigamesh.eu</a>) based rendering, Phong-shaded 3D models, and photographs as well as illumination augmentation. The results show that using rendered 3D images for sign detection performs better than other work on photographs. In addition, our approach gives reasonably good results for photographs only, while it is best used for mixed datasets. More importantly, the Phong renderings, and especially the MSII renderings, improve the results on photographs, which is the largest dataset on a global scale.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Generating both plausible and accurate full body avatar motion is the key to the quality of immersive experiences in mixed reality scenarios. Head-Mounted Devices (HMDs) typically only provide a few input signals, such as head and hands 6-DoF. Recently, different approaches achieved impressive performance in generating full body motion given only head and hands signal. However, to the best of our knowledge, all existing approaches rely on full hand visibility. While this is the case when, e.g., using motion controllers, a considerable proportion of mixed reality experiences do not involve motion controllers and instead rely on egocentric hand tracking. This introduces the challenge of partial hand visibility owing to the restricted field of view of the HMD. In this paper, we propose the first unified approach, HMD-NeMo, that addresses plausible and accurate full body motion generation even when the hands may be only partially visible. HMD-NeMo is a lightweight neural network that predicts the full body motion in an online and real-time fashion. At the heart of HMD-NeMo is the spatio-temporal encoder with novel temporally adaptable mask tokens that encourage plausible motion in the absence of hand observations. We perform extensive analysis of the impact of different components in HMD-NeMo and introduce a new state-of-the-art on AMASS dataset through our evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Previous work on long-term video action recognition relies on deep 3D-convolutional models that have a large temporal receptive field (RF). We argue that these models are not always the best choice for temporal modeling in videos. A large temporal receptive field allows the model to encode the exact sub-action order of a video, which causes a performance decrease when testing videos have a different sub-action order. In this work, we investigate whether we can improve the model robustness to the sub-action order by shrinking the temporal receptive field of action recognition models. For this, we design Video BagNet, a variant of the 3D ResNet-50 model with the temporal receptive field size limited to 1, 9, 17 or 33 frames. We analyze Video BagNet on synthetic and real-world video datasets and experimentally compare models with varying temporal receptive fields. We find that short receptive fields are robust to sub-action order changes, while larger temporal receptive fields are sensitive to the sub-action order.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Many real-world applications, from sport analysis to surveillance, benefit from automatic long-term action recognition. In the current deep learning paradigm for automatic action recognition, it is imperative that models are trained and tested on datasets and tasks that evaluate if such models actually learn and reason over long-term information. In this work, we propose a method to evaluate how suitable a video dataset is to evaluate models for long-term action recognition. To this end, we define a long-term action as excluding all the videos that can be correctly recognized using solely short-term information. We test this definition on existing long-term classification tasks on three popular real-world datasets, namely Breakfast, CrossTask and LVU, to determine if these datasets are truly evaluating long-term recognition. Our study reveals that these datasets can be effectively solved using shortcuts based on short-term information. Following this finding, we encourage long-term action recognition researchers to make use of datasets that need long-term information to be solved.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Learning object segmentation in image and video datasets without human supervision is a challenging problem. Humans easily identify moving salient objects in videos using the gestalt principle of common fate, which suggests that what moves together belongs together. Building upon this idea, we propose a self-supervised object discovery approach that leverages motion and appearance information to produce high-quality object segmentation masks. Specifically, we redesign the traditional graph cut on images to include motion information in a linear combination with appearance information to produce edge weights. Remarkably, this step produces object segmentation masks comparable to the current state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks. To further improve performance, we bootstrap a segmentation network trained on these preliminary masks as pseudo-ground truths to learn from its own outputs via self-training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, named LOCATE, on multiple standard video object segmentation, image saliency detection, and object segmentation benchmarks, achieving results on par with and, in many cases surpassing state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the transferability of our approach to novel domains through a qualitative study on in-the-wild images. Additionally, we present extensive ablation analysis to support our design choices and highlight the contribution of each component of our proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Visual affordance segmentation identifies the surfaces of an object an agent can interact with. Common challenges for the identification of affordances are the variety of the geometry and physical properties of these surfaces as well as occlusions. In this paper, we focus on occlusions of an object that is hand-held by a person manipulating it. To address this challenge, we propose an affordance segmentation model that uses auxiliary branches to process the object and hand regions separately. The proposed model learns affordance features under hand-occlusion by weighting the feature map through hand and object segmentation. To train the model, we annotated the visual affordances of an existing dataset with mixed-reality images of hand-held containers in third-person (exocentric) images. Experiments on both real and mixed-reality images show that our model achieves better affordance segmentation and generalisation than existing models.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Modern computer vision services often require users to share raw feature descriptors with an untrusted server. This presents an inherent privacy risk, as raw descriptors may be used to recover the source images from which they were extracted. To address this issue, researchers recently proposed privatizing image features by embedding them within an affine subspace containing the original feature as well as adversarial feature samples. In this paper, we propose two novel inversion attacks to show that it is possible to (approximately) recover the original image features from these embeddings, allowing us to recover privacy-critical image content. In light of such successes and the lack of theoretical privacy guarantees afforded by existing visual privacy methods, we further propose the first method to privatize image features via local differential privacy, which, unlike prior approaches, provides a guaranteed bound for privacy leakage regardless of the strength of the attacks. In addition, our method yields strong performance in visual localization as a downstream task while enjoying the privacy guarantee.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Cross-modal garment synthesis and manipulation will significantly benefit the way fashion designers generate garments and modify their designs via flexible linguistic interfaces.Current approaches follow the general text-to-image paradigm and mine cross-modal relations via simple cross-attention modules, neglecting the structural correspondence between visual and textual representations in the fashion design domain. In this work, we instead introduce DiffCloth, a diffusion-based pipeline for cross-modal garment synthesis and manipulation, which empowers diffusion models with flexible compositionality in the fashion domain by structurally aligning the cross-modal semantics. Specifically, we formulate the part-level cross-modal alignment as a bipartite matching problem between the linguistic Attribute-Phrases (AP) and the visual garment parts which are obtained via constituency parsing and semantic segmentation, respectively. To mitigate the issue of attribute confusion, we further propose a semantic-bundled cross-attention to preserve the spatial structure similarities between the attention maps of attribute adjectives and part nouns in each AP. Moreover, DiffCloth allows for manipulation of the generated results by simply replacing APs in the text prompts. The manipulation-irrelevant regions are recognized by blended masks obtained from the bundled attention maps of the APs and kept unchanged. Extensive experiments on the CM-Fashion benchmark demonstrate that DiffCloth both yields state-of-the-art garment synthesis results by leveraging the inherent structural information and supports flexible manipulation with region consistency.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Few-shot segmentation (FSS) is a dense prediction task that aims to infer the pixel-wise labels of unseen classes using only a limited number of annotated images. The key challenge in FSS is to classify the labels of query pixels using class prototypes learned from the few labeled support exemplars. Prior approaches to FSS have typically focused on learning class-wise descriptors independently from support images, thereby ignoring the rich contextual information and mutual dependencies among support-query features. To address this limitation, we propose a joint learning method termed Masked Cross-Image Encoding (MCE), which is designed to capture common visual properties that describe object details and to learn bidirectional inter-image dependencies that enhance feature interaction. MCE is more than a visual representation enrichment module; it also considers cross-image mutual dependencies and implicit guidance. Experiments on FSS benchmarks PASCAL-$5^i$ and COCO-$20^i$ demonstrate the advanced meta-learning ability of the proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Transformers have demonstrated tremendous success not only in the natural language processing (NLP) domain but also the field of computer vision, igniting various creative approaches and applications. Yet, the superior performance and modeling flexibility of transformers came with a severe increase in computation costs, and hence several works have proposed methods to reduce this burden. Inspired by a cost-cutting method originally proposed for language models, Data Multiplexing (DataMUX), we propose a novel approach for efficient visual recognition that employs additional dim1 batching (i.e., concatenation) that greatly improves the throughput with little compromise in the accuracy. We first introduce a naive adaptation of DataMux for vision models, Image Multiplexer, and devise novel components to overcome its weaknesses, rendering our final model, ConcatPlexer, at the sweet spot between inference speed and accuracy. The ConcatPlexer was trained on ImageNet1K and CIFAR100 dataset and it achieved 23.5% less GFLOPs than ViT-B&#x2F;16 with 69.5% and 83.4% validation accuracy, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Hand-object interaction understanding and the barely addressed novel view synthesis are highly desired in the immersive communication, whereas it is challenging due to the high deformation of hand and heavy occlusions between hand and object. In this paper, we propose a neural rendering and pose estimation system for hand-object interaction from sparse views, which can also enable 3D hand-object interaction editing. We share the inspiration from recent scene understanding work that shows a scene specific model built beforehand can significantly improve and unblock vision tasks especially when inputs are sparse, and extend it to the dynamic hand-object interaction scenario and propose to solve the problem in two stages. We first learn the shape and appearance prior knowledge of hands and objects separately with the neural representation at the offline stage. During the online stage, we design a rendering-based joint model fitting framework to understand the dynamic hand-object interaction with the pre-built hand and object models as well as interaction priors, which thereby overcomes penetration and separation issues between hand and object and also enables novel view synthesis. In order to get stable contact during the hand-object interaction process in a sequence, we propose a stable contact loss to make the contact region to be consistent. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Abstract:<br>Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP and ALIGN, are generally trained on datasets consisting of image-caption pairs obtained from the web. However, real-world multimodal datasets, such as healthcare data, are significantly more complex: each image (e.g. X-ray) is often paired with text (e.g. physician report) that describes many distinct attributes occurring in fine-grained regions of the image. We refer to these samples as exhibiting high pairwise complexity, since each image-text pair can be decomposed into a large number of region-attribute pairings. The extent to which VLMs can capture fine-grained relationships between image regions and textual attributes when trained on such data has not been previously evaluated. The first key contribution of this work is to demonstrate through systematic evaluations that as the pairwise complexity of the training dataset increases, standard VLMs struggle to learn region-attribute relationships, exhibiting performance degradations of up to 37% on retrieval tasks. In order to address this issue, we introduce ViLLA as our second key contribution. ViLLA, which is trained to capture fine-grained region-attribute relationships from complex datasets, involves two components: (a) a lightweight, self-supervised mapping model to decompose image-text samples into region-attribute pairs, and (b) a contrastive VLM to learn representations from generated region-attribute pairs. We demonstrate with experiments across four domains (synthetic, product, medical, and natural images) that ViLLA outperforms comparable VLMs on fine-grained reasoning tasks, such as zero-shot object detection (up to 3.6 AP50 points on COCO and 0.6 mAP points on LVIS) and retrieval (up to 14.2 R-Precision points).</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Pre-trained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, working with manually designed prompts have demonstrated great capacity of transfer learning. Recently, learnable prompts achieve state-of-the-art performance, which however are prone to overfit to seen classes, failing to generalize to unseen classes. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge-Aware Prompt Tuning (KAPT) framework for vision-language models. Our approach takes inspiration from human intelligence in which external knowledge is usually incorporated into recognizing novel categories of objects. Specifically, we design two complementary types of knowledge-aware prompts for the text encoder to leverage the distinctive characteristics of category-related external knowledge. The discrete prompt extracts the key information from descriptions of an object category, and the learned continuous prompt captures overall contexts. We further design an adaptation head for the visual encoder to aggregate salient attentive visual cues, which establishes discriminative and task-aware visual representations. We conduct extensive experiments on 11 widely-used benchmark datasets and the results verify the effectiveness in few-shot image classification, especially in generalizing to unseen categories. Compared with the state-of-the-art CoCoOp method, KAPT exhibits favorable performance and achieves an absolute gain of 3.22% on new classes and 2.57% in terms of harmonic mean.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Previous research has studied the task of segmenting cinematic videos into scenes and into narrative acts. However, these studies have overlooked the essential task of multimodal alignment and fusion for effectively and efficiently processing long-form videos (&gt;60min). In this paper, we introduce Multimodal alignmEnt aGgregation and distillAtion (MEGA) for cinematic long-video segmentation. MEGA tackles the challenge by leveraging multiple media modalities. The method coarsely aligns inputs of variable lengths and different modalities with alignment positional encoding. To maintain temporal synchronization while reducing computation, we further introduce an enhanced bottleneck fusion layer which uses temporal alignment. Additionally, MEGA employs a novel contrastive loss to synchronize and transfer labels across modalities, enabling act segmentation from labeled synopsis sentences on video shots. Our experimental results show that MEGA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on MovieNet dataset for scene segmentation (with an Average Precision improvement of +1.19%) and on TRIPOD dataset for act segmentation (with a Total Agreement improvement of +5.51%)</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We present Recurrent Fitting (ReFit), a neural network architecture for single-image, parametric 3D human reconstruction. ReFit learns a feedback-update loop that mirrors the strategy of solving an inverse problem through optimization. At each iterative step, it reprojects keypoints from the human model to feature maps to query feedback, and uses a recurrent-based updater to adjust the model to fit the image better. Because ReFit encodes strong knowledge of the inverse problem, it is faster to train than previous regression models. At the same time, ReFit improves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. Moreover, ReFit applies to other optimization settings, such as multi-view fitting and single-view shape fitting.

<p>Abstract:<br>Simultaneous segmentation and classification of nuclei in digital histology play an essential role in computer-assisted cancer diagnosis; however, it remains challenging. The highest achieved binary and multi-class Panoptic Quality (PQ) remains as low as 0.68 bPQ and 0.49 mPQ, respectively. It is due to the higher staining variability, variability across the tissue, rough clinical conditions, overlapping nuclei, and nuclear class imbalance. The generic deep-learning methods usually rely on end-to-end models, which fail to address these problems associated explicitly with digital histology. In our previous work, DAN-NucNet, we resolved these issues for semantic segmentation with an end-to-end model. This work extends our previous model to simultaneous instance segmentation and classification. We introduce additional decoder heads with independent weighted losses, which produce semantic segmentation, edge proposals, and classification maps. We use the outputs from the three-head model to apply post-processing to produce the final segmentation and classification. Our multi-stage approach utilizes edge proposals and semantic segmentations compared to direct segmentation and classification strategies followed by most state-of-the-art methods. Due to this, we demonstrate a significant performance improvement in producing high-quality instance segmentation and nuclei classification. We have achieved a 0.841 Dice score for semantic segmentation, 0.713 bPQ scores for instance segmentation, and 0.633 mPQ for nuclei classification. Our proposed framework is generalized across 19 types of tissues. Furthermore, the framework is less complex compared to the state-of-the-art.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Engaging video comments play an important role in video social media, as they are the carrier of feelings, thoughts, or humor of the audience. Preliminary works have made initial exploration for video comment generation by adopting caption-style encoder-decoder models. However, comment generation presents some unique challenges distinct from caption generation, which makes these methods somewhat less effective at generating engaging comments. In contrast to the objective and descriptive nature of captions, comments tend to be inherently subjective, making it hard to quantify and evaluate the engagement of comments. Furthermore, the scarcity of truly engaging comments brings difficulty to collecting enough high-quality training examples. In this paper, we propose ViCo with three novel designs to tackle the above challenges for generating engaging Video Comments. Firstly, to quantify the engagement of comments, we utilize the number of “likes” each comment receives as a proxy of human preference after an appropriate debiasing procedure. Secondly, to automatically evaluate the engagement of comments, we train a reward model to align its judgment to the above proxy. Our user studies indicate that this reward model effectively aligns with human judgments. Lastly, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality comments, an initial generator is trained on readily available but noisy data to generate comments. Then the reward model is employed to offer feedback on the generated comments, thus optimizing the initial generator. To facilitate the research of video commenting, we collect a large video comment-dataset (ViCo-20k) with rich metadata from a popular video website. Experiments on ViCo-20k show that the comments generated by our ViCo model exhibit the best performance in terms of both quantitative and qualitative results, particularly when engagement is considered.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Impressive performance on point cloud semantic segmentation has been achieved by fully-supervised methods with large amounts of labelled data. As it is labour-intensive to acquire large-scale point cloud data with point-wise labels, many attempts have been made to explore learning 3D point cloud segmentation with limited annotations. Active learning is one of the effective strategies to achieve this purpose but is still under-explored. The most recent methods of this kind measure the uncertainty of each pre-divided region for manual labelling but they suffer from redundant information and require additional efforts for region division. This paper aims at addressing this issue by developing a hierarchical point-based active learning strategy. Specifically, we measure the uncertainty for each point by a hierarchical minimum margin uncertainty module which considers the contextual information at multiple levels. Then, a feature-distance suppression strategy is designed to select important and representative points for manual labelling. Besides, to better exploit the unlabelled data, we build a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on our active strategy. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNetV2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves 96.5% and 100% performance of fully-supervised baseline with only 0.07% and 0.1% training data, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art weakly-supervised and active learning methods.

<p>Abstract:<br>Misalignments between multi-modality images pose challenges in image fusion, manifesting as structural distortions and edge ghosts. Existing efforts commonly resort to registering first and fusing later, typically employing two cascaded stages for registration,i.e., coarse registration and fine registration. Both stages directly estimate the respective target deformation fields. In this paper, we argue that the separated two-stage registration is not compact, and the direct estimation of the target deformation fields is not accurate enough. To address these challenges, we propose a Cross-modality Multi-scale Progressive Dense Registration (C-MPDR) scheme, which accomplishes the coarse-to-fine registration exclusively using a one-stage optimization, thus improving the fusion performance of misaligned multi-modality images. Specifically, two pivotal components are involved, a dense Deformation Field Fusion (DFF) module and a Progressive Feature Fine (PFF) module. The DFF aggregates the predicted multi-scale deformation sub-fields at the current scale, while the PFF progressively refines the remaining misaligned features. Both work together to accurately estimate the final deformation fields. In addition, we develop a Transformer-Conv-based Fusion (TCF) subnetwork that considers local and long-range feature dependencies, allowing us to capture more informative features from the registered infrared and visible images for the generation of high-quality fused images. Extensive experimental analysis demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method in the fusion of misaligned cross-modality images.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In recent, some robust contrastive multi-view clustering (MvC) methods have been proposed, which construct data pairs from neighborhoods to alleviate the false negative issue, i.e., some intra-cluster samples are wrongly treated as negative pairs. Although promising performance has been achieved by these methods, the false negative issue is still far from addressed and the false positive issue emerges because all in- and out-of-neighborhood samples are simply treated as positive and negative, respectively. To address the issues, we propose a novel robust method, dubbed decoupled contrastive multi-view clustering with high-order random walks (DIVIDE). In brief, DIVIDE leverages random walks to progressively identify data pairs in a global instead of local manner. As a result, DIVIDE could identify in-neighborhood negatives and out-of-neighborhood positives. Moreover, DIVIDE embraces a novel MvC architecture to perform inter- and intra-view contrastive learning in different embedding spaces, thus boosting clustering performance and embracing the robustness against missing views. To verify the efficacy of DIVIDE, we carry out extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets comparing with nine state-of-the-art MvC methods in both complete and incomplete MvC settings.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. They include a group of malignant neoplasms with a variety of biological, clinical, and histopathological characteristics. There are more than 35 different histological forms of breast lesions that can be classified and diagnosed histologically according to cell morphology, growth, and architecture patterns. Recently, deep learning, in the field of artificial intelligence, has drawn a lot of attention for the computerized representation of medical images. Searchable digital atlases can provide pathologists with patch matching tools allowing them to search among evidently diagnosed and treated archival cases, a technology that may be regarded as computational second opinion. In this study, we indexed and analyzed the WHO breast taxonomy (Classification of Tumours 5th Ed.) spanning 35 tumour types. We visualized all tumour types using deep features extracted from a state-of-the-art deep learning model, pre-trained on millions of diagnostic histopathology images from the TCGA repository. Furthermore, we test the concept of a digital “atlas” as a reference for search and matching with rare test cases. The patch similarity search within the WHO breast taxonomy data reached over 88% accuracy when validating through “majority vote” and more than 91% accuracy when validating using top-n tumour types. These results show for the first time that complex relationships among common and rare breast lesions can be investigated using an indexed digital archive.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Among the current mainstream change detection networks, transformer is deficient in the ability to capture accurate low-level details, while convolutional neural network (CNN) is wanting in the capacity to understand global information and establish remote spatial relationships. Meanwhile, both of the widely used early fusion and late fusion frameworks are not able to well learn complete change features. Therefore, based on swin transformer V2 (Swin V2) and VGG16, we propose an end-to-end compounded dense network SwinV2DNet to inherit the advantages of both transformer and CNN and overcome the shortcomings of existing networks in feature learning. Firstly, it captures the change relationship features through the densely connected Swin V2 backbone, and provides the low-level pre-changed and post-changed features through a CNN branch. Based on these three change features, we accomplish accurate change detection results. Secondly, combined with transformer and CNN, we propose mixed feature pyramid (MFP) which provides inter-layer interaction information and intra-layer multi-scale information for complete feature learning. MFP is a plug and play module which is experimentally proven to be also effective in other change detection networks. Further more, we impose a self-supervision strategy to guide a new CNN branch, which solves the untrainable problem of the CNN branch and provides the semantic change information for the features of encoder. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) change detection scores and fine-grained change maps were obtained compared with other advanced methods on four commonly used public remote sensing datasets.

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper offers a new perspective to ease the challenge of domain generalization, which involves maintaining robust results even in unseen environments. Our design focuses on the decision-making process in the final classifier layer. Specifically, we propose treating the element-wise contributions to the final results as the rationale for making a decision and representing the rationale for each sample as a matrix. For a well-generalized model, we suggest the rationale matrices for samples belonging to the same category should be similar, indicating the model relies on domain-invariant clues to make decisions, thereby ensuring robust results. To implement this idea, we introduce a rationale invariance loss as a simple regularization technique, requiring only a few lines of code. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive results across various datasets, despite its simplicity.

<p>Abstract:<br>Video data and algorithms have been driving advances in multi-object tracking (MOT). While existing MOT datasets focus on occlusion and appearance similarity, complex motion patterns are widespread yet overlooked. To address this issue, we introduce a new dataset called BEE23 to highlight complex motions. Identity association algorithms have long been the focus of MOT research. Existing trackers can be categorized into two association paradigms: single-feature paradigm (based on either motion or appearance feature) and serial paradigm (one feature serves as secondary while the other is primary). However, these paradigms are incapable of fully utilizing different features. In this paper, we propose a parallel paradigm and present the Two rOund Parallel matchIng meChanism (TOPIC) to implement it. The TOPIC leverages both motion and appearance features and can adaptively select the preferable one as the assignment metric based on motion level. Moreover, we provide an Attention-based Appearance Reconstruct Module (AARM) to reconstruct appearance feature embeddings, thus enhancing the representation of appearance features. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets and BEE23. Notably, our proposed parallel paradigm surpasses the performance of existing association paradigms by a large margin, e.g., reducing false negatives by 12% to 51% compared to the single-feature association paradigm. The introduced dataset and association paradigm in this work offers a fresh perspective for advancing the MOT field.

<p>Abstract:<br>The success of supervised deep learning models on cell recognition tasks relies on detailed annotations. Many previous works have managed to reduce the dependency on labels. However, considering the large number of cells contained in a patch, costly and inefficient labeling is still inevitable. To this end, we explored label-free methods for cell recognition. Prior self-activation maps (PSM) are proposed to generate pseudo masks as training targets. To be specific, an activation network is trained with self-supervised learning. The gradient information in the shallow layers of the network is aggregated to generate prior self-activation maps. Afterward, a semantic clustering module is then introduced as a pipeline to transform PSMs to pixel-level semantic pseudo masks for downstream tasks. We evaluated our method on two histological datasets: MoNuSeg (cell segmentation) and BCData (multi-class cell detection). Compared with other fully-supervised and weakly-supervised methods, our method can achieve competitive performance without any manual annotations. Our simple but effective framework can also achieve multi-class cell detection which can not be done by existing unsupervised methods. The results show the potential of PSMs that might inspire other research to deal with the hunger for labels in medical area.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>High dynamic range (HDR) imaging is a highly challenging task since a large amount of information is lost due to the limitations of camera sensors. For HDR imaging, some methods capture multiple low dynamic range (LDR) images with altering exposures to aggregate more information. However, these approaches introduce ghosting artifacts when significant inter-frame motions are present. Moreover, although multi-exposure images are given, we have little information in severely over-exposed areas. Most existing methods focus on motion compensation, i.e., alignment of multiple LDR shots to reduce the ghosting artifacts, but they still produce unsatisfying results. These methods also rather overlook the need to restore the saturated areas. In this paper, we generate well-aligned multi-exposure features by reformulating a motion alignment problem into a simple brightness adjustment problem. In addition, we propose a coarse-to-fine merging strategy with explicit saturation compensation. The saturated areas are reconstructed with similar well-exposed content using adaptive contextual attention. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods regarding qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recent work on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has demonstrated significant advances in high-quality view synthesis. A major limitation of NeRF is its low rendering efficiency due to the need for multiple network forwardings to render a single pixel. Existing methods to improve NeRF either reduce the number of required samples or optimize the implementation to accelerate the network forwarding. Despite these efforts, the problem of multiple sampling persists due to the intrinsic representation of radiance fields. In contrast, Neural Light Fields (NeLF) reduce the computation cost of NeRF by querying only one single network forwarding per pixel. To achieve a close visual quality to NeRF, existing NeLF methods require significantly larger network capacities which limits their rendering efficiency in practice. In this work, we propose a new representation called Neural Radiance Distribution Field (NeRDF) that targets efficient view synthesis in real-time. Specifically, we use a small network similar to NeRF while preserving the rendering speed with a single network forwarding per pixel as in NeLF. The key is to model the radiance distribution along each ray with frequency basis and predict frequency weights using the network. Pixel values are then computed via volume rendering on radiance distributions. Experiments show that our proposed method offers a better trade-off among speed, quality, and network size than existing methods: we achieve a ~254x speed-up over NeRF with similar network size, with only a marginal performance decline.

<p>Abstract:<br>Generative models have seen an explosion in popularity with the release of huge generative Diffusion models like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion to the public. Because of this new ease of access, questions surrounding the automated collection of data and issues regarding content ownership have started to build. In this paper we present new work which aims to provide ways of protecting content when shared to the public. We show that a generative Diffusion model trained on data that has been imperceptibly watermarked will generate new images with these watermarks present. We further show that if a given watermark is correlated with a certain feature of the training data, the generated images will also have this correlation. Using statistical tests we show that we are able to determine whether a model has been trained on marked data, and what data was marked. As a result our system offers a solution to protect intellectual property when sharing content online.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper presents a novel method that leverages a visual-language model, CLIP, as a data source for zero-shot anomaly detection. Tremendous efforts have been put towards developing anomaly detectors due to their potential industrial applications. Considering the difficulty in acquiring various anomalous samples for training, most existing methods train models with only normal samples and measure discrepancies from the distribution of normal samples during inference, which requires training a model for each object category. The problem of this inefficient training requirement has been tackled by designing a CLIP-based anomaly detector that applies prompt-guided classification to each part of an image in a sliding window manner. However, the method still suffers from the labor of careful prompt ensembling with known object categories. To overcome the issues above, we propose leveraging CLIP as a data source for training. Our method generates text embeddings with the text encoder in CLIP with typical prompts that include words of normal and anomaly. In addition to these words, we insert several randomly generated words into prompts, which enables the encoder to generate a diverse set of normal and anomalous samples. Using the generated embeddings as training data, a feed-forward neural network learns to extract features of normal and anomaly from CLIP’s embeddings, and as a result, a category-agnostic anomaly detector can be obtained without any training images. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without laborious prompt ensembling in zero-shot setups.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>As demands for high-quality videos continue to rise, high-resolution and high-dynamic range (HDR) imaging techniques are drawing attention. To generate an HDR video from low dynamic range (LDR) images, one of the critical steps is the motion compensation between LDR frames, for which most existing works employed the optical flow algorithm. However, these methods suffer from flow estimation errors when saturation or complicated motions exist. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end HDR video composition framework, which aligns LDR frames in the feature space and then merges aligned features into an HDR frame, without relying on pixel-domain optical flow. Specifically, we propose a luminance-based alignment network for HDR (LAN-HDR) consisting of an alignment module and a hallucination module. The alignment module aligns a frame to the adjacent reference by evaluating luminance-based attention, excluding color information. The hallucination module generates sharp details, especially for washed-out areas due to saturation. The aligned and hallucinated features are then blended adaptively to complement each other. Finally, we merge the features to generate a final HDR frame. In training, we adopt a temporal loss, in addition to frame reconstruction losses, to enhance temporal consistency and thus reduce flickering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method performs better or comparable to state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper proposes a novel quantum pre-processing filter (QPF) to improve the image classification accuracy of neural network (NN) models. A simple four qubit quantum circuit that uses Y rotation gates for encoding and two controlled NOT gates for creating correlation among the qubits is applied as a feature extraction filter prior to passing data into the fully connected NN architecture. By applying the QPF approach, the results show that the image classification accuracy based on the MNIST (handwritten 10 digits) and the EMNIST (handwritten 47 class digits and letters) datasets can be improved, from 92.5% to 95.4% and from 68.9% to 75.9%, respectively. These improvements were obtained without introducing extra model parameters or optimizations in the machine learning process. However, tests performed on the developed QPF approach against a relatively complex GTSRB dataset with 43 distinct class real-life traffic sign images showed a degradation in the classification accuracy. Considering this result, further research into the understanding and the design of a more suitable quantum circuit approach for image classification neural networks could be explored utilizing the baseline method proposed in this paper.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The Automated Model Evaluation (AutoEval) framework entertains the possibility of evaluating a trained machine learning model without resorting to a labeled testing set. Despite the promise and some decent results, the existing AutoEval methods heavily rely on computing distribution shifts between the unlabelled testing set and the training set. We believe this reliance on the training set becomes another obstacle in shipping this technology to real-world ML development. In this work, we propose Contrastive Automatic Model Evaluation (CAME), a novel AutoEval framework that is rid of involving training set in the loop. The core idea of CAME bases on a theoretical analysis which bonds the model performance with a contrastive loss. Further, with extensive empirical validation, we manage to set up a predictable relationship between the two, simply by deducing on the unlabeled&#x2F;unseen testing set. The resulting framework CAME establishes a new SOTA results for AutoEval by surpassing prior work significantly.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In Asian countries, there is a tradition that a rabbit (the Moon rabbit) lives on the Moon. As the origin of this tradition, usually, two reasons are mentioned. One reason is that the color pattern of the lunar surface is similar to the shape of a rabbit. The other reason is that both the Moon and rabbit are symbols of fertility because the Moon appears and disappears (i.e., waxing and waning) cyclically, and rabbits bear children frequently. Considering the latter reason, is the lunar surface color pattern not similar to a rabbit? Here, the similarity between rabbit and the lunar surface pattern was evaluated using seven AI architectures. In the test by CLIP, assuming that people look at the Moon in the early evening frequently, the lunar surface is more similar to a rabbit than a face at low latitude regions, while it can be classified as face as latitude increases, which is consistent with that the oldest literature about the Moon rabbit was written in India and that there is a culture of human’s face in the Moon in Europe. Tested with ImageNet weights, ConvNeXt and CLIP sometimes classified the lunar surface pattern into rabbit with relatively high probabilities. Cultures are generated by our attitude to the environment. Both dynamic and static similarities may be required to induce our imagination.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>A novel algorithm to detect road lanes in videos, called recursive video lane detector (RVLD), is proposed in this paper, which propagates the state of a current frame recursively to the next frame. RVLD consists of an intra-frame lane detector (ILD) and a predictive lane detector (PLD). First, we design ILD to localize lanes in a still frame. Second, we develop PLD to exploit the information of the previous frame for lane detection in a current frame. To this end, we estimate a motion field and warp the previous output to the current frame. Using the warped information, we refine the feature map of the current frame to detect lanes more reliably. Experimental results show that RVLD outperforms existing detectors on video lane datasets.

<p>Abstract:<br>We present an architecture and a training recipe that adapts pre-trained open-world image models to localization in videos. Understanding the open visual world (without being constrained by fixed label spaces) is crucial for many real-world vision tasks. Contrastive pre-training on large image-text datasets has recently led to significant improvements for image-level tasks. For more structured tasks involving object localization applying pre-trained models is more challenging. This is particularly true for video tasks, where task-specific data is limited. We show successful transfer of open-world models by building on the OWL-ViT open-vocabulary detection model and adapting it to video by adding a transformer decoder. The decoder propagates object representations recurrently through time by using the output tokens for one frame as the object queries for the next. Our model is end-to-end trainable on video data and enjoys improved temporal consistency compared to tracking-by-detection baselines, while retaining the open-world capabilities of the backbone detector. We evaluate our model on the challenging TAO-OW benchmark and demonstrate that open-world capabilities, learned from large-scale image-text pre-training, can be transferred successfully to open-world localization across diverse videos.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Algorithmic Fairness and the explainability of potentially unfair outcomes are crucial for establishing trust and accountability of Artificial Intelligence systems in domains such as healthcare and policing. Though significant advances have been made in each of the fields separately, achieving explainability in fairness applications remains challenging, particularly so in domains where deep neural networks are used. At the same time, ethical data-mining has become ever more relevant, as it has been shown countless times that fairness-unaware algorithms result in biased outcomes. Current approaches focus on mitigating biases in the outcomes of the model, but few attempts have been made to try to explain \emph{why} a model is biased. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive approach that leverages optimal transport theory to uncover the causes and implications of biased regions in images, which easily extends to tabular data as well. Through the use of Wasserstein barycenters, we obtain scores that are independent of a sensitive variable but keep their marginal orderings. This step ensures predictive accuracy but also helps us to recover the regions most associated with the generation of the biases. Our findings hold significant implications for the development of trustworthy and unbiased AI systems, fostering transparency, accountability, and fairness in critical decision-making scenarios across diverse domains.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Predicting high dimensional video sequences is a curiously difficult problem. The number of possible futures for a given video sequence grows exponentially over time due to uncertainty. This is especially evident when trying to predict complicated natural video scenes from a limited snapshot of the world. The inherent uncertainty accumulates the further into the future you predict making long-term prediction very difficult. In this work we introduce a number of improvements to existing work that aid in creating Robust Video Predictors (RoViPs). We show that with a combination of deep Perceptual and uncertainty-based reconstruction losses we are able to create high quality short-term predictions. Attention-based skip connections are utilised to allow for long range spatial movement of input features to further improve performance. Finally, we show that by simply making the predictor robust to its own prediction errors, it is possible to produce very long, realistic natural video sequences using an iterated single-step prediction task.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In this paper, we introduce audio-visual class-incremental learning, a class-incremental learning scenario for audio-visual video recognition. We demonstrate that joint audio-visual modeling can improve class-incremental learning, but current methods fail to preserve semantic similarity between audio and visual features as incremental step grows. Furthermore, we observe that audio-visual correlations learned in previous tasks can be forgotten as incremental steps progress, leading to poor performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose AV-CIL, which incorporates Dual-Audio-Visual Similarity Constraint (D-AVSC) to maintain both instance-aware and class-aware semantic similarity between audio-visual modalities and Visual Attention Distillation (VAD) to retain previously learned audio-guided visual attentive ability. We create three audio-visual class-incremental datasets, AVE-Class-Incremental (AVE-CI), Kinetics-Sounds-Class-Incremental (K-S-CI), and VGGSound100-Class-Incremental (VS100-CI) based on the AVE, Kinetics-Sounds, and VGGSound datasets, respectively. Our experiments on AVE-CI, K-S-CI, and VS100-CI demonstrate that AV-CIL significantly outperforms existing class-incremental learning methods in audio-visual class-incremental learning.

<p>Abstract:<br>Video anomaly detection (VAD) without human monitoring is a complex computer vision task that can have a positive impact on society if implemented successfully. While recent advances have made significant progress in solving this task, most existing approaches overlook a critical real-world concern: privacy. With the increasing popularity of artificial intelligence technologies, it becomes crucial to implement proper AI ethics into their development. Privacy leakage in VAD allows models to pick up and amplify unnecessary biases related to people’s personal information, which may lead to undesirable decision making. In this paper, we propose TeD-SPAD, a privacy-aware video anomaly detection framework that destroys visual private information in a self-supervised manner. In particular, we propose the use of a temporally-distinct triplet loss to promote temporally discriminative features, which complements current weakly-supervised VAD methods. Using TeD-SPAD, we achieve a positive trade-off between privacy protection and utility anomaly detection performance on three popular weakly supervised VAD datasets: UCF-Crime, XD-Violence, and ShanghaiTech. Our proposed anonymization model reduces private attribute prediction by 32.25% while only reducing frame-level ROC AUC on the UCF-Crime anomaly detection dataset by 3.69%.

<p>Abstract:<br>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success in various applications including video action recognition, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks (Trojans). The backdoor-compromised model will mis-classify to the target class chosen by the attacker when a test instance (from a non-target class) is embedded with a specific trigger, while maintaining high accuracy on attack-free instances. Although there are extensive studies on backdoor attacks against image data, the susceptibility of video-based systems under backdoor attacks remains largely unexplored. Current studies are direct extensions of approaches proposed for image data, e.g., the triggers are \textbf{independently} embedded within the frames, which tend to be detectable by existing defenses. In this paper, we introduce a \textit{simple} yet \textit{effective} backdoor attack against video data. Our proposed attack, adding perturbations in a transformed domain, plants an \textbf{imperceptible, temporally distributed} trigger across the video frames, and is shown to be resilient to existing defensive strategies. The effectiveness of the proposed attack is demonstrated by extensive experiments with various well-known models on two video recognition benchmarks, UCF101 and HMDB51, and a sign language recognition benchmark, Greek Sign Language (GSL) dataset. We delve into the impact of several influential factors on our proposed attack and identify an intriguing effect termed “collateral damage” through extensive studies.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In this paper, we consider a real-world scenario where a model that is trained on pre-defined classes continually encounters unlabeled data that contains both known and novel classes. The goal is to continually discover novel classes while maintaining the performance in known classes. We name the setting Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD). Existing methods for novel class discovery cannot directly handle the C-GCD setting due to some unrealistic assumptions, such as the unlabeled data only containing novel classes. Furthermore, they fail to discover novel classes in a continual fashion. In this work, we lift all these assumptions and propose an approach, called MetaGCD, to learn how to incrementally discover with less forgetting. Our proposed method uses a meta-learning framework and leverages the offline labeled data to simulate the testing incremental learning process. A meta-objective is defined to revolve around two conflicting learning objectives to achieve novel class discovery without forgetting. Furthermore, a soft neighborhood-based contrastive network is proposed to discriminate uncorrelated images while attracting correlated images. We build strong baselines and conduct extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks to demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>While large-scale image-text pretrained models such as CLIP have been used for multiple video-level tasks on trimmed videos, their use for temporal localization in untrimmed videos is still a relatively unexplored task. We design a new approach for this called UnLoc, which uses pretrained image and text towers, and feeds tokens to a video-text fusion model. The output of the fusion module are then used to construct a feature pyramid in which each level connects to a head to predict a per-frame relevancy score and start&#x2F;end time displacements. Unlike previous works, our architecture enables Moment Retrieval, Temporal Localization, and Action Segmentation with a single stage model, without the need for action proposals, motion based pretrained features or representation masking. Unlike specialized models, we achieve state of the art results on all three different localization tasks with a unified approach.

<p>Abstract:<br>In recent years, several Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WS3) methods have been proposed that use class activation maps (CAMs) generated by a classifier to produce pseudo-ground truths for training segmentation models. While CAMs are good at highlighting discriminative regions (DR) of an image, they are known to disregard regions of the object that do not contribute to the classifier’s prediction, termed non-discriminative regions (NDR). In contrast, attribution methods such as saliency maps provide an alternative approach for assigning a score to every pixel based on its contribution to the classification prediction. This paper provides a comprehensive comparison between saliencies and CAMs for WS3. Our study includes multiple perspectives on understanding their similarities and dissimilarities. Moreover, we provide new evaluation metrics that perform a comprehensive assessment of WS3 performance of alternative methods w.r.t. CAMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of saliencies in addressing the limitation of CAMs through our empirical studies on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we propose random cropping as a stochastic aggregation technique that improves the performance of saliency, making it a strong alternative to CAM for WS3.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>For machine learning-based prognosis and diagnosis of rare diseases, such as pediatric brain tumors, it is necessary to gather medical imaging data from multiple clinical sites that may use different devices and protocols. Deep learning-driven harmonization of radiologic images relies on generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs notoriously generate pseudo structures that do not exist in the original training data, a phenomenon known as “hallucination”. To prevent hallucination in medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain, we propose a one-shot learning method where we utilize neural style transfer for harmonization. At test time, the method uses one image from a clinical site to generate an image that matches the intensity scale of the collaborating sites. Our approach combines learning a feature extractor, neural style transfer, and adaptive instance normalization. We further propose a novel strategy to evaluate the effectiveness of image harmonization approaches with evaluation metrics that both measure image style harmonization and assess the preservation of anatomical structures. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in preserving patient anatomy while adjusting the image intensities to a new clinical site. Our general harmonization model can be used on unseen data from new sites, making it a valuable tool for real-world medical applications and clinical trials.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In recent years, huge progress has been made on learning neural implicit representations from multi-view images for 3D reconstruction. As an additional input complementing coordinates, using sinusoidal functions as positional encodings plays a key role in revealing high frequency details with coordinate-based neural networks. However, high frequency positional encodings make the optimization unstable, which results in noisy reconstructions and artifacts in empty space. To resolve this issue in a general sense, we introduce to learn neural implicit representations with quantized coordinates, which reduces the uncertainty and ambiguity in the field during optimization. Instead of continuous coordinates, we discretize continuous coordinates into discrete coordinates using nearest interpolation among quantized coordinates which are obtained by discretizing the field in an extremely high resolution. We use discrete coordinates and their positional encodings to learn implicit functions through volume rendering. This significantly reduces the variations in the sample space, and triggers more multi-view consistency constraints on intersections of rays from different views, which enables to infer implicit function in a more effective way. Our quantized coordinates do not bring any computational burden, and can seamlessly work upon the latest methods. Our evaluations under the widely used benchmarks show our superiority over the state-of-the-art.

<p>Abstract:<br>There are many ways of interpreting the world and they are highly interdependent. We exploit such complex dependencies and introduce a powerful multi-task hypergraph, in which every node is a task and different paths through the hypergraph reaching a given task become unsupervised teachers, by forming ensembles that learn to generate reliable pseudolabels for that task. Each hyperedge is part of an ensemble teacher for a given task and it is also a student of the self-supervised hypergraph system. We apply our model to one of the most important problems of our times, that of Earth Observation, which is highly multi-task and it often suffers from missing ground-truth data. By performing extensive experiments on the NASA NEO Dataset, spanning a period of 22 years, we demonstrate the value of our multi-task semi-supervised approach, by consistent improvements over strong baselines and recent work. We also show that the hypergraph can adapt unsupervised to gradual data distribution shifts and reliably recover, through its multi-task self-supervision process, the missing data for several observational layers for up to seven years.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We propose a novel transformer-based framework that reconstructs two high fidelity hands from multi-view RGB images. Unlike existing hand pose estimation methods, where one typically trains a deep network to regress hand model parameters from single RGB image, we consider a more challenging problem setting where we directly regress the absolute root poses of two-hands with extended forearm at high resolution from egocentric view. As existing datasets are either infeasible for egocentric viewpoints or lack background variations, we create a large-scale synthetic dataset with diverse scenarios and collect a real dataset from multi-calibrated camera setup to verify our proposed multi-view image feature fusion strategy. To make the reconstruction physically plausible, we propose two strategies: (i) a coarse-to-fine spectral graph convolution decoder to smoothen the meshes during upsampling and (ii) an optimisation-based refinement stage at inference to prevent self-penetrations. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that our framework is able to produce realistic two-hand reconstructions and demonstrate the generalisation of synthetic-trained models to real data, as well as real-time AR&#x2F;VR applications.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases, and its short atmospheric half-life makes it a prime target to rapidly curb global warming. However, current methane emission monitoring techniques primarily rely on approximate emission factors or self-reporting, which have been shown to often dramatically underestimate emissions. Although initially designed to monitor surface properties, satellite multispectral data has recently emerged as a powerful method to analyze atmospheric content. However, the spectral resolution of multispectral instruments is poor, and methane measurements are typically very noisy. Methane data products are also sensitive to absorption by the surface and other atmospheric gases (water vapor in particular) and therefore provide noisy maps of potential methane plumes, that typically require extensive human analysis. Here, we show that the image recognition capabilities of deep learning methods can be leveraged to automatize the detection of methane leaks in Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral data, with dramatically reduced false positive rates compared with state-of-the-art multispectral methane data products, and without the need for a priori knowledge of potential leak sites. Our proposed approach paves the way for the automated, high-definition and high-frequency monitoring of point-source methane emissions across the world.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Functional tissue Units (FTUs) are cell population neighborhoods local to a particular organ performing its main function. The FTUs provide crucial information to the pathologist in understanding the disease affecting a particular organ by providing information at the cellular level. In our research, we have developed a model to segment multi-organ FTUs across 5 organs namely: the kidney, large intestine, lung, prostate and spleen by utilizing the HuBMAP + HPA - Hacking the Human Body competition dataset. We propose adding shifted auxiliary loss for training models like the transformers to overcome the diminishing gradient problem which poses a challenge towards optimal training of deep models. Overall, our model achieved a dice score of 0.793 on the public dataset and 0.778 on the private dataset and shows a 1% improvement with the use of the proposed method. The findings also bolster the use of transformers models for dense prediction tasks in the field of medical image analysis. The study assists in understanding the relationships between cell and tissue organization thereby providing a useful medium to look at the impact of cellular functions on human health.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Deep learning models can perform well in complex medical imaging classification tasks, even when basing their conclusions on spurious correlations (i.e. confounders), should they be prevalent in the training dataset, rather than on the causal image markers of interest. This would thereby limit their ability to generalize across the population. Explainability based on counterfactual image generation can be used to expose the confounders but does not provide a strategy to mitigate the bias. In this work, we introduce the first end-to-end training framework that integrates both (i) popular debiasing classifiers (e.g. distributionally robust optimization (DRO)) to avoid latching onto the spurious correlations and (ii) counterfactual image generation to unveil generalizable imaging markers of relevance to the task. Additionally, we propose a novel metric, Spurious Correlation Latching Score (SCLS), to quantify the extent of the classifier reliance on the spurious correlation as exposed by the counterfactual images. Through comprehensive experiments on two public datasets (with the simulated and real visual artifacts), we demonstrate that the debiasing method: (i) learns generalizable markers across the population, and (ii) successfully ignores spurious correlations and focuses on the underlying disease pathology.</p>

Given that different people can provide different answers to a visual question, we aim to better understand why with answer groundings. We introduce the first dataset that visually grounds each unique answer to each visual question, which we call VQAAnswerTherapy. We then propose two novel problems of predicting whether a visual question has a single answer grounding and localizing all answer groundings. We benchmark modern algorithms for these novel problems to show where they succeed and struggle.

<p>Abstract:<br>Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection has developed substantially in the past few years, with available methods approaching, and in a few cases achieving, perfect data separation on standard benchmarks. These results generally involve large or complex models, pretraining, exposure to OoD examples or extra hyperparameter tuning. Remarkably, it is possible to achieve results that can exceed many of these state-of-the-art methods with a very simple method. We demonstrate that ResNet18 trained with Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL) produces state-of-the-art results out-of-the-box on near and far OoD detection benchmarks using only Euclidean distance as a scoring rule. This may obviate the need in some cases for more sophisticated methods or larger models, and at the very least provides a very strong, easy to use baseline for further experimentation and analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recent works have demonstrated success in MRI reconstruction using deep learning-based models. However, most reported approaches require training on a task-specific, large-scale dataset. Regularization by denoising (RED) is a general pipeline which embeds a denoiser as a prior for image reconstruction. The potential of RED has been demonstrated for multiple image-related tasks such as denoising, deblurring and super-resolution. In this work, we propose a regularization by neural style transfer (RNST) method to further leverage the priors from the neural transfer and denoising engine. This enables RNST to reconstruct a high-quality image from a noisy low-quality image with different image styles and limited data. We validate RNST with clinical MRI scans from 1.5T and 3T and show that RNST can significantly boost image quality. Our results highlight the capability of the RNST framework for MRI reconstruction and the potential for reconstruction tasks with limited data.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This work presents BundleSeg, a reliable, reproducible, and fast method for extracting white matter pathways. The proposed method combines an iterative registration procedure with a recently developed precise streamline search algorithm that enables efficient segmentation of streamlines without the need for tractogram clustering or simplifying assumptions. We show that BundleSeg achieves improved repeatability and reproducibility than state-of-the-art segmentation methods, with significant speed improvements. The enhanced precision and reduced variability in extracting white matter connections offer a valuable tool for neuroinformatic studies, increasing the sensitivity and specificity of tractography-based studies of white matter pathways.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can be optimized to obtain high-fidelity 3D scene reconstructions of objects and large-scale scenes. However, NeRFs require accurate camera parameters as input – inaccurate camera parameters result in blurry renderings. Extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters are usually estimated using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods as a pre-processing step to NeRF, but these techniques rarely yield perfect estimates. Thus, prior works have proposed jointly optimizing camera parameters alongside a NeRF, but these methods are prone to local minima in challenging settings. In this work, we analyze how different camera parameterizations affect this joint optimization problem, and observe that standard parameterizations exhibit large differences in magnitude with respect to small perturbations, which can lead to an ill-conditioned optimization problem. We propose using a proxy problem to compute a whitening transform that eliminates the correlation between camera parameters and normalizes their effects, and we propose to use this transform as a preconditioner for the camera parameters during joint optimization. Our preconditioned camera optimization significantly improves reconstruction quality on scenes from the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset: we reduce error rates (RMSE) by 67% compared to state-of-the-art NeRF approaches that do not optimize for cameras like Zip-NeRF, and by 29% relative to state-of-the-art joint optimization approaches using the camera parameterization of SCNeRF. Our approach is easy to implement, does not significantly increase runtime, can be applied to a wide variety of camera parameterizations, and can straightforwardly be incorporated into other NeRF-like models.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We tackle the problem of learning complex, general behaviors directly in the real world. We propose an approach for robots to efficiently learn manipulation skills using only a handful of real-world interaction trajectories from many different settings. Inspired by the success of learning from large-scale datasets in the fields of computer vision and natural language, our belief is that in order to efficiently learn, a robot must be able to leverage internet-scale, human video data. Humans interact with the world in many interesting ways, which can allow a robot to not only build an understanding of useful actions and affordances but also how these actions affect the world for manipulation. Our approach builds a structured, human-centric action space grounded in visual affordances learned from human videos. Further, we train a world model on human videos and fine-tune on a small amount of robot interaction data without any task supervision. We show that this approach of affordance-space world models enables different robots to learn various manipulation skills in complex settings, in under 30 minutes of interaction.

<p>Abstract:<br>We study the problem of few-shot physically-aware articulated mesh generation. By observing an articulated object dataset containing only a few examples, we wish to learn a model that can generate diverse meshes with high visual fidelity and physical validity. Previous mesh generative models either have difficulties in depicting a diverse data space from only a few examples or fail to ensure physical validity of their samples. Regarding the above challenges, we propose two key innovations, including 1) a hierarchical mesh deformation-based generative model based upon the divide-and-conquer philosophy to alleviate the few-shot challenge by borrowing transferrable deformation patterns from large scale rigid meshes and 2) a physics-aware deformation correction scheme to encourage physically plausible generations. We conduct extensive experiments on 6 articulated categories to demonstrate the superiority of our method in generating articulated meshes with better diversity, higher visual fidelity, and better physical validity over previous methods in the few-shot setting. Further, we validate solid contributions of our two innovations in the ablation study.

<p>Abstract:<br>We present a framework for generating appropriate facial responses from a listener in dyadic social interactions based on the speaker’s words. Given an input transcription of the speaker’s words with their timestamps, our approach autoregressively predicts a response of a listener: a sequence of listener facial gestures, quantized using a VQ-VAE. Since gesture is a language component, we propose treating the quantized atomic motion elements as additional language token inputs to a transformer-based large language model. Initializing our transformer with the weights of a language model pre-trained only on text results in significantly higher quality listener responses than training a transformer from scratch. We show that our generated listener motion is fluent and reflective of language semantics through quantitative metrics and a qualitative user study. In our evaluation, we analyze the model’s ability to utilize temporal and semantic aspects of spoken text.

<p>Abstract:<br>We show how shadows can be efficiently generated in differentiable rendering of triangle meshes. Our central observation is that pre-filtered shadow mapping, a technique for approximating shadows based on rendering from the perspective of a light, can be combined with existing differentiable rasterizers to yield differentiable visibility information. We demonstrate at several inverse graphics problems that differentiable shadow maps are orders of magnitude faster than differentiable light transport simulation with similar accuracy – while differentiable rasterization without shadows often fails to converge.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Privacy-preserving machine learning aims to train models on private data without leaking sensitive information. Differential privacy (DP) is considered the gold standard framework for privacy-preserving training, as it provides formal privacy guarantees. However, compared to their non-private counterparts, models trained with DP often have significantly reduced accuracy. Private classifiers are also believed to exhibit larger performance disparities across subpopulations, raising fairness concerns. The poor performance of classifiers trained with DP has prevented the widespread adoption of privacy preserving machine learning in industry. Here we show that pre-trained foundation models fine-tuned with DP can achieve similar accuracy to non-private classifiers, even in the presence of significant distribution shifts between pre-training data and downstream tasks. We achieve private accuracies within a few percent of the non-private state of the art across four datasets, including two medical imaging benchmarks. Furthermore, our private medical classifiers do not exhibit larger performance disparities across demographic groups than non-private models. This milestone to make DP training a practical and reliable technology has the potential to widely enable machine learning practitioners to train safely on sensitive datasets while protecting individuals’ privacy.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This is a further development of Vision Transformer Pruning via matrix decomposition. The purpose of the Vision Transformer Pruning is to prune the dimension of the linear projection of the dataset by learning their associated importance score in order to reduce the storage, run-time memory, and computational demands. In this paper we further reduce dimension and complexity of the linear projection by implementing and comparing several matrix decomposition methods while preserving the generated important features. We end up selected the Singular Value Decomposition as the method to achieve our goal by comparing the original accuracy scores in the original Github repository and the accuracy scores of using those matrix decomposition methods, including Singular Value Decomposition, four versions of QR Decomposition, and LU factorization.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Visual Place Recognition is a task that aims to predict the place of an image (called query) based solely on its visual features. This is typically done through image retrieval, where the query is matched to the most similar images from a large database of geotagged photos, using learned global descriptors. A major challenge in this task is recognizing places seen from different viewpoints. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new method, called EigenPlaces, to train our neural network on images from different point of views, which embeds viewpoint robustness into the learned global descriptors. The underlying idea is to cluster the training data so as to explicitly present the model with different views of the same points of interest. The selection of this points of interest is done without the need for extra supervision. We then present experiments on the most comprehensive set of datasets in literature, finding that EigenPlaces is able to outperform previous state of the art on the majority of datasets, while requiring 60% less GPU memory for training and using 50% smaller descriptors. The code and trained models for EigenPlaces are available at {\small{\url{<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/gmberton/EigenPlaces%7D%7D%7D">https://github.com/gmberton/EigenPlaces}}}</a>, while results with any other baseline can be computed with the codebase at {\small{\url{<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/gmberton/auto_VPR%7D%7D%7D">https://github.com/gmberton/auto_VPR}}}</a>.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Hyperspectral Image (HSI) reconstruction has made gratifying progress with the deep unfolding framework by formulating the problem into a data module and a prior module. Nevertheless, existing methods still face the problem of insufficient matching with HSI data. The issues lie in three aspects: 1) fixed gradient descent step in the data module while the degradation of HSI is agnostic in the pixel-level. 2) inadequate prior module for 3D HSI cube. 3) stage interaction ignoring the differences in features at different stages. To address these issues, in this work, we propose a Pixel Adaptive Deep Unfolding Transformer (PADUT) for HSI reconstruction. In the data module, a pixel adaptive descent step is employed to focus on pixel-level agnostic degradation. In the prior module, we introduce the Non-local Spectral Transformer (NST) to emphasize the 3D characteristics of HSI for recovering. Moreover, inspired by the diverse expression of features in different stages and depths, the stage interaction is improved by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Experimental results on both simulated and real scenes exhibit the superior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art HSI reconstruction methods.

<p>Abstract:<br>Quantization scale and bit-width are the most important parameters when considering how to quantize a neural network. Prior work focuses on optimizing quantization scales in a global manner through gradient methods (gradient descent &amp; Hessian analysis). Yet, when applying perturbations to quantization scales, we observe a very jagged, highly non-smooth test loss landscape. In fact, small perturbations in quantization scale can greatly affect accuracy, yielding a $0.5-0.8%$ accuracy boost in 4-bit quantized vision transformers (ViTs). In this regime, gradient methods break down, since they cannot reliably reach local minima. In our work, dubbed Evol-Q, we use evolutionary search to effectively traverse the non-smooth landscape. Additionally, we propose using an infoNCE loss, which not only helps combat overfitting on the small calibration dataset ($1,000$ images) but also makes traversing such a highly non-smooth surface easier. Evol-Q improves the top-1 accuracy of a fully quantized ViT-Base by $10.30%$, $0.78%$, and $0.15%$ for $3$-bit, $4$-bit, and $8$-bit weight quantization levels. Extensive experiments on a variety of CNN and ViT architectures further demonstrate its robustness in extreme quantization scenarios.

<p>Abstract:<br>Recently, the ability of language models (LMs) has attracted increasing attention in visual cross-modality. In this paper, we further explore the generation capacity of LMs for sound event detection (SED), beyond the visual domain. Specifically, we propose an elegant method that aligns audio features and text features to accomplish sound event classification and temporal location. The framework consists of an acoustic encoder, a contrastive module that align the corresponding representations of the text and audio, and a decoupled language decoder that generates temporal and event sequences from the audio characteristic. Compared with conventional works that require complicated processing and barely utilize limited audio features, our model is more concise and comprehensive since language model directly leverage its semantic capabilities to generate the sequences. We investigate different decoupling modules to demonstrate the effectiveness for timestamps capture and event classification. Evaluation results show that the proposed method achieves accurate sequences of sound event detection.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The hearing loss of almost half a billion people is commonly treated with hearing aids. However, current hearing aids often do not work well in real-world noisy environments. We present a deep learning based denoising system that runs in real time on iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S10 (25ms algorithmic latency). The denoised audio is streamed to the hearing aid, resulting in a total delay of around 75ms. In tests with hearing aid users having moderate to severe hearing loss, our denoising system improves audio across three tests: 1) listening for subjective audio ratings, 2) listening for objective speech intelligibility, and 3) live conversations in a noisy environment for subjective ratings. Subjective ratings increase by more than 40%, for both the listening test and the live conversation compared to a fitted hearing aid as a baseline. Speech reception thresholds, measuring speech understanding in noise, improve by 1.6 dB SRT. Ours is the first denoising system that is implemented on a mobile device, streamed directly to users’ hearing aids using only a single channel as audio input while improving user satisfaction on all tested aspects, including speech intelligibility. This includes overall preference of the denoised and streamed signal over the hearing aid, thereby accepting the higher latency for the significant improvement in speech understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper presents an end-to-end model designed to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) for a particular speaker in a crowded, noisy environment. The model utilizes a single-channel speech enhancement module that isolates the speaker’s voice from background noise, along with an ASR module. Through this approach, the model is able to decrease the word error rate (WER) of ASR from 80% to 26.4%. Typically, these two components are adjusted independently due to variations in data requirements. However, speech enhancement can create anomalies that decrease ASR efficiency. By implementing a joint fine-tuning strategy, the model can reduce the WER from 26.4% in separate tuning to 14.5% in joint tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Speaker anonymization systems continue to improve their ability to obfuscate the original speaker characteristics in a speech signal, but often create processing artifacts and unnatural sounding voices as a tradeoff. Many of those systems stem from the VoicePrivacy Challenge (VPC) Baseline B1, using a neural vocoder to synthesize speech from an F0, x-vectors and bottleneck features-based speech representation. Inspired by this, we investigate the reproduction capabilities of the aforementioned baseline, to assess how successful the shared methodology is in synthesizing human-like speech. We use four objective metrics to measure speech quality, waveform similarity, and F0 similarity. Our findings indicate that both the speech representation and the vocoder introduces artifacts, causing an unnatural perception. A MUSHRA-like listening test on 18 subjects corroborate our findings, motivating further research on the analysis and synthesis components of the VPC Baseline B1.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Text-to-music generation (T2M-Gen) faces a major obstacle due to the scarcity of large-scale publicly available music datasets with natural language captions. To address this, we propose the Music Understanding LLaMA (MU-LLaMA), capable of answering music-related questions and generating captions for music files. Our model utilizes audio representations from a pretrained MERT model to extract music features. However, obtaining a suitable dataset for training the MU-LLaMA model remains challenging, as existing publicly accessible audio question answering datasets lack the necessary depth for open-ended music question answering. To fill this gap, we present a methodology for generating question-answer pairs from existing audio captioning datasets and introduce the MusicQA Dataset designed for answering open-ended music-related questions. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed MU-LLaMA model, trained on our designed MusicQA dataset, achieves outstanding performance in both music question answering and music caption generation across various metrics, outperforming current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in both fields and offering a promising advancement in the T2M-Gen research field.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Tablature notation is widely used in popular music to transcribe and share guitar musical content. As a complement to standard score notation, tablatures transcribe performance gesture information including finger positions and a variety of guitar-specific playing techniques such as slides, hammer-on&#x2F;pull-off or bends.This paper focuses on bends, which enable to progressively shift the pitch of a note, therefore circumventing physical limitations of the discrete fretted fingerboard. In this paper, we propose a set of 25 high-level features, computed for each note of the tablature, to study how bend occurrences can be predicted from their past and future short-term context. Experiments are performed on a corpus of 932 lead guitar tablatures of popular music and show that a decision tree successfully predicts bend occurrences with an F1 score of 0.71 anda limited amount of false positive predictions, demonstrating promising applications to assist the arrangement of non-guitar music into guitar tablatures.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Wav2vec2 has achieved success in applying Transformer architecture and self-supervised learning to speech recognition. Recently, these have come to be used not only for speech recognition but also for the entire speech processing. This paper introduces an effective end-to-end speaker identification model applied Transformer-based contextual model. We explored the relationship between the parameters and the performance in order to discern the structure of an effective model. Furthermore, we propose a pooling method, Temporal Gate Pooling, with powerful learning ability for speaker identification. We applied Conformer as encoder and BEST-RQ for pre-training and conducted an evaluation utilizing the speaker identification of VoxCeleb1. The proposed method has achieved an accuracy of 85.9% with 28.5M parameters, demonstrating comparable precision to wav2vec2 with 317.7M parameters.

<p>Abstract:<br>Voice conversion as the style transfer task applied to speech, refers to converting one person’s speech into a new speech that sounds like another person’s. Up to now, there has been a lot of research devoted to better implementation of VC tasks. However, a good voice conversion model should not only match the timbre information of the target speaker, but also expressive information such as prosody, pace, pause, etc. In this context, prosody modeling is crucial for achieving expressive voice conversion that sounds natural and convincing. Unfortunately, prosody modeling is important but challenging, especially without text transcriptions. In this paper, we firstly propose a novel voice conversion framework named ‘PMVC’, which effectively separates and models the content, timbre, and prosodic information from the speech without text transcriptions. Specially, we introduce a new speech augmentation algorithm for robust prosody extraction. And building upon this, mask and predict mechanism is applied in the disentanglement of prosody and content information. The experimental results on the AIShell-3 corpus supports our improvement of naturalness and similarity of converted speech.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Echo cancellation and noise reduction are essential for full-duplex communication, yet most existing neural networks have high computational costs and are inflexible in tuning model complexity. In this paper, we introduce time-frequency dual-path compression to achieve a wide range of compression ratios on computational cost. Specifically, for frequency compression, trainable filters are used to replace manually designed filters for dimension reduction. For time compression, only using frame skipped prediction causes large performance degradation, which can be alleviated by a post-processing network with full sequence modeling. We have found that under fixed compression ratios, dual-path compression combining both the time and frequency methods will give further performance improvement, covering compression ratios from 4x to 32x with little model size change. Moreover, the proposed models show competitive performance compared with fast FullSubNet and DeepFilterNet.

<p>Abstract:<br>Recently, the ability of language models (LMs) has attracted increasing attention in visual cross-modality. In this paper, we further explore the generation capacity of LMs for sound event detection (SED), beyond the visual domain. Specifically, we propose an elegant method that aligns audio features and text features to accomplish sound event classification and temporal location. The framework consists of an acoustic encoder, a contrastive module that align the corresponding representations of the text and audio, and a decoupled language decoder that generates temporal and event sequences from the audio characteristic. Compared with conventional works that require complicated processing and barely utilize limited audio features, our model is more concise and comprehensive since language model directly leverage its semantic capabilities to generate the sequences. We investigate different decoupling modules to demonstrate the effectiveness for timestamps capture and event classification. Evaluation results show that the proposed method achieves accurate sequences of sound event detection.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The hearing loss of almost half a billion people is commonly treated with hearing aids. However, current hearing aids often do not work well in real-world noisy environments. We present a deep learning based denoising system that runs in real time on iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S10 (25ms algorithmic latency). The denoised audio is streamed to the hearing aid, resulting in a total delay of around 75ms. In tests with hearing aid users having moderate to severe hearing loss, our denoising system improves audio across three tests: 1) listening for subjective audio ratings, 2) listening for objective speech intelligibility, and 3) live conversations in a noisy environment for subjective ratings. Subjective ratings increase by more than 40%, for both the listening test and the live conversation compared to a fitted hearing aid as a baseline. Speech reception thresholds, measuring speech understanding in noise, improve by 1.6 dB SRT. Ours is the first denoising system that is implemented on a mobile device, streamed directly to users’ hearing aids using only a single channel as audio input while improving user satisfaction on all tested aspects, including speech intelligibility. This includes overall preference of the denoised and streamed signal over the hearing aid, thereby accepting the higher latency for the significant improvement in speech understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper presents an end-to-end model designed to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) for a particular speaker in a crowded, noisy environment. The model utilizes a single-channel speech enhancement module that isolates the speaker’s voice from background noise, along with an ASR module. Through this approach, the model is able to decrease the word error rate (WER) of ASR from 80% to 26.4%. Typically, these two components are adjusted independently due to variations in data requirements. However, speech enhancement can create anomalies that decrease ASR efficiency. By implementing a joint fine-tuning strategy, the model can reduce the WER from 26.4% in separate tuning to 14.5% in joint tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Speaker anonymization systems continue to improve their ability to obfuscate the original speaker characteristics in a speech signal, but often create processing artifacts and unnatural sounding voices as a tradeoff. Many of those systems stem from the VoicePrivacy Challenge (VPC) Baseline B1, using a neural vocoder to synthesize speech from an F0, x-vectors and bottleneck features-based speech representation. Inspired by this, we investigate the reproduction capabilities of the aforementioned baseline, to assess how successful the shared methodology is in synthesizing human-like speech. We use four objective metrics to measure speech quality, waveform similarity, and F0 similarity. Our findings indicate that both the speech representation and the vocoder introduces artifacts, causing an unnatural perception. A MUSHRA-like listening test on 18 subjects corroborate our findings, motivating further research on the analysis and synthesis components of the VPC Baseline B1.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Text-to-music generation (T2M-Gen) faces a major obstacle due to the scarcity of large-scale publicly available music datasets with natural language captions. To address this, we propose the Music Understanding LLaMA (MU-LLaMA), capable of answering music-related questions and generating captions for music files. Our model utilizes audio representations from a pretrained MERT model to extract music features. However, obtaining a suitable dataset for training the MU-LLaMA model remains challenging, as existing publicly accessible audio question answering datasets lack the necessary depth for open-ended music question answering. To fill this gap, we present a methodology for generating question-answer pairs from existing audio captioning datasets and introduce the MusicQA Dataset designed for answering open-ended music-related questions. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed MU-LLaMA model, trained on our designed MusicQA dataset, achieves outstanding performance in both music question answering and music caption generation across various metrics, outperforming current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in both fields and offering a promising advancement in the T2M-Gen research field.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Tablature notation is widely used in popular music to transcribe and share guitar musical content. As a complement to standard score notation, tablatures transcribe performance gesture information including finger positions and a variety of guitar-specific playing techniques such as slides, hammer-on&#x2F;pull-off or bends.This paper focuses on bends, which enable to progressively shift the pitch of a note, therefore circumventing physical limitations of the discrete fretted fingerboard. In this paper, we propose a set of 25 high-level features, computed for each note of the tablature, to study how bend occurrences can be predicted from their past and future short-term context. Experiments are performed on a corpus of 932 lead guitar tablatures of popular music and show that a decision tree successfully predicts bend occurrences with an F1 score of 0.71 anda limited amount of false positive predictions, demonstrating promising applications to assist the arrangement of non-guitar music into guitar tablatures.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Wav2vec2 has achieved success in applying Transformer architecture and self-supervised learning to speech recognition. Recently, these have come to be used not only for speech recognition but also for the entire speech processing. This paper introduces an effective end-to-end speaker identification model applied Transformer-based contextual model. We explored the relationship between the parameters and the performance in order to discern the structure of an effective model. Furthermore, we propose a pooling method, Temporal Gate Pooling, with powerful learning ability for speaker identification. We applied Conformer as encoder and BEST-RQ for pre-training and conducted an evaluation utilizing the speaker identification of VoxCeleb1. The proposed method has achieved an accuracy of 85.9% with 28.5M parameters, demonstrating comparable precision to wav2vec2 with 317.7M parameters.

<p>Abstract:<br>The aim of this work is to perform a multitemporal analysis using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for the detection of changes in urban areas using optical data and specific machine learning (ML) algorithms. As a case study, Cairo City has been identified, in Egypt country, as one of the five most populous megacities of the last decade in the world. Classification and change detection analysis of the region of interest (ROI) have been carried out from July 2013 to July 2021. Results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method in identifying changed and unchanged urban areas over the selected period. Furthermore, this work aims to evidence the growing significance of GEE as an efficient cloud-based solution for managing large quantities of satellite data.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Learning meaningful representations is at the heart of many tasks in the field of modern machine learning. Recently, a lot of methods were introduced that allow learning of image representations without supervision. These representations can then be used in downstream tasks like classification or object detection. The quality of these representations is close to supervised learning, while no labeled images are needed. This survey paper provides a comprehensive review of these methods in a unified notation, points out similarities and differences of these methods, and proposes a taxonomy which sets these methods in relation to each other. Furthermore, our survey summarizes the most-recent experimental results reported in the literature in form of a meta-study. Our survey is intended as a starting point for researchers and practitioners who want to dive into the field of representation learning.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We address the problem of learning Deep Learning Radiomics (DLR) that are not redundant with Hand-Crafted Radiomics (HCR). To do so, we extract DLR features using a VAE while enforcing their independence with HCR features by minimizing their mutual information. The resulting DLR features can be combined with hand-crafted ones and leveraged by a classifier to predict early markers of cancer. We illustrate our method on four early markers of pancreatic cancer and validate it on a large independent test set. Our results highlight the value of combining non-redundant DLR and HCR features, as evidenced by an improvement in the Area Under the Curve compared to baseline methods that do not address redundancy or solely rely on HCR features.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In this study, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical data are both considered for Earth surface classification. Specifically, the integration of Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data is carried out through supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms implemented on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for the classification of a particular region of interest. Achieved results demonstrate how in this case radar and optical remote detection provide complementary information, benefiting surface cover classification and generally leading to increased mapping accuracy.

<p>Abstract:<br>T1 mapping is a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) technique that has emerged as a valuable tool in the diagnosis of diffuse myocardial diseases. However, prevailing approaches have relied heavily on breath-hold sequences to eliminate respiratory motion artifacts. This limitation hinders accessibility and effectiveness for patients who cannot tolerate breath-holding. Image registration can be used to enable free-breathing T1 mapping. Yet, inherent intensity differences between the different time points make the registration task challenging. We introduce PCMC-T1, a physically-constrained deep-learning model for motion correction in free-breathing T1 mapping. We incorporate the signal decay model into the network architecture to encourage physically-plausible deformations along the longitudinal relaxation axis. We compared PCMC-T1 to baseline deep-learning-based image registration approaches using a 5-fold experimental setup on a publicly available dataset of 210 patients. PCMC-T1 demonstrated superior model fitting quality (R2: 0.955) and achieved the highest clinical impact (clinical score: 3.93) compared to baseline methods (0.941, 0.946 and 3.34, 3.62 respectively). Anatomical alignment results were comparable (Dice score: 0.9835 vs. 0.984, 0.988).

<p>Abstract:<br>Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. They include a group of malignant neoplasms with a variety of biological, clinical, and histopathological characteristics. There are more than 35 different histological forms of breast lesions that can be classified and diagnosed histologically according to cell morphology, growth, and architecture patterns. Recently, deep learning, in the field of artificial intelligence, has drawn a lot of attention for the computerized representation of medical images. Searchable digital atlases can provide pathologists with patch matching tools allowing them to search among evidently diagnosed and treated archival cases, a technology that may be regarded as computational second opinion. In this study, we indexed and analyzed the WHO breast taxonomy (Classification of Tumours 5th Ed.) spanning 35 tumour types. We visualized all tumour types using deep features extracted from a state-of-the-art deep learning model, pre-trained on millions of diagnostic histopathology images from the TCGA repository. Furthermore, we test the concept of a digital “atlas” as a reference for search and matching with rare test cases. The patch similarity search within the WHO breast taxonomy data reached over 88% accuracy when validating through “majority vote” and more than 91% accuracy when validating using top-n tumour types. These results show for the first time that complex relationships among common and rare breast lesions can be investigated using an indexed digital archive.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>One of the primary sources of suboptimal image quality in ultrasound imaging is phase aberration. It is caused by spatial changes in sound speed over a heterogeneous medium, which disturbs the transmitted waves and prevents coherent summation of echo signals. Obtaining non-aberrated ground truths in real-world scenarios can be extremely challenging, if not impossible. This challenge hinders training of deep learning-based techniques’ performance due to the presence of domain shift between simulated and experimental data. Here, for the first time, we propose a deep learning-based method that does not require ground truth to correct the phase aberration problem, and as such, can be directly trained on real data. We train a network wherein both the input and target output are randomly aberrated radio frequency (RF) data. Moreover, we demonstrate that a conventional loss function such as mean square error is inadequate for training such a network to achieve optimal performance. Instead, we propose an adaptive mixed loss function that employs both B-mode and RF data, resulting in more efficient convergence and enhanced performance. Finally, we publicly release our dataset, including 161,701 single plane-wave images (RF data). This dataset serves to mitigate the data scarcity problem in the development of deep learning-based techniques for phase aberration correction.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Generative models have seen an explosion in popularity with the release of huge generative Diffusion models like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion to the public. Because of this new ease of access, questions surrounding the automated collection of data and issues regarding content ownership have started to build. In this paper we present new work which aims to provide ways of protecting content when shared to the public. We show that a generative Diffusion model trained on data that has been imperceptibly watermarked will generate new images with these watermarks present. We further show that if a given watermark is correlated with a certain feature of the training data, the generated images will also have this correlation. Using statistical tests we show that we are able to determine whether a model has been trained on marked data, and what data was marked. As a result our system offers a solution to protect intellectual property when sharing content online.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>For machine learning-based prognosis and diagnosis of rare diseases, such as pediatric brain tumors, it is necessary to gather medical imaging data from multiple clinical sites that may use different devices and protocols. Deep learning-driven harmonization of radiologic images relies on generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs notoriously generate pseudo structures that do not exist in the original training data, a phenomenon known as “hallucination”. To prevent hallucination in medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain, we propose a one-shot learning method where we utilize neural style transfer for harmonization. At test time, the method uses one image from a clinical site to generate an image that matches the intensity scale of the collaborating sites. Our approach combines learning a feature extractor, neural style transfer, and adaptive instance normalization. We further propose a novel strategy to evaluate the effectiveness of image harmonization approaches with evaluation metrics that both measure image style harmonization and assess the preservation of anatomical structures. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in preserving patient anatomy while adjusting the image intensities to a new clinical site. Our general harmonization model can be used on unseen data from new sites, making it a valuable tool for real-world medical applications and clinical trials.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Functional tissue Units (FTUs) are cell population neighborhoods local to a particular organ performing its main function. The FTUs provide crucial information to the pathologist in understanding the disease affecting a particular organ by providing information at the cellular level. In our research, we have developed a model to segment multi-organ FTUs across 5 organs namely: the kidney, large intestine, lung, prostate and spleen by utilizing the HuBMAP + HPA - Hacking the Human Body competition dataset. We propose adding shifted auxiliary loss for training models like the transformers to overcome the diminishing gradient problem which poses a challenge towards optimal training of deep models. Overall, our model achieved a dice score of 0.793 on the public dataset and 0.778 on the private dataset and shows a 1% improvement with the use of the proposed method. The findings also bolster the use of transformers models for dense prediction tasks in the field of medical image analysis. The study assists in understanding the relationships between cell and tissue organization thereby providing a useful medium to look at the impact of cellular functions on human health.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Deep learning models can perform well in complex medical imaging classification tasks, even when basing their conclusions on spurious correlations (i.e. confounders), should they be prevalent in the training dataset, rather than on the causal image markers of interest. This would thereby limit their ability to generalize across the population. Explainability based on counterfactual image generation can be used to expose the confounders but does not provide a strategy to mitigate the bias. In this work, we introduce the first end-to-end training framework that integrates both (i) popular debiasing classifiers (e.g. distributionally robust optimization (DRO)) to avoid latching onto the spurious correlations and (ii) counterfactual image generation to unveil generalizable imaging markers of relevance to the task. Additionally, we propose a novel metric, Spurious Correlation Latching Score (SCLS), to quantify the extent of the classifier reliance on the spurious correlation as exposed by the counterfactual images. Through comprehensive experiments on two public datasets (with the simulated and real visual artifacts), we demonstrate that the debiasing method: (i) learns generalizable markers across the population, and (ii) successfully ignores spurious correlations and focuses on the underlying disease pathology.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This work presents BundleSeg, a reliable, reproducible, and fast method for extracting white matter pathways. The proposed method combines an iterative registration procedure with a recently developed precise streamline search algorithm that enables efficient segmentation of streamlines without the need for tractogram clustering or simplifying assumptions. We show that BundleSeg achieves improved repeatability and reproducibility than state-of-the-art segmentation methods, with significant speed improvements. The enhanced precision and reduced variability in extracting white matter connections offer a valuable tool for neuroinformatic studies, increasing the sensitivity and specificity of tractography-based studies of white matter pathways.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Hyperspectral Image (HSI) reconstruction has made gratifying progress with the deep unfolding framework by formulating the problem into a data module and a prior module. Nevertheless, existing methods still face the problem of insufficient matching with HSI data. The issues lie in three aspects: 1) fixed gradient descent step in the data module while the degradation of HSI is agnostic in the pixel-level. 2) inadequate prior module for 3D HSI cube. 3) stage interaction ignoring the differences in features at different stages. To address these issues, in this work, we propose a Pixel Adaptive Deep Unfolding Transformer (PADUT) for HSI reconstruction. In the data module, a pixel adaptive descent step is employed to focus on pixel-level agnostic degradation. In the prior module, we introduce the Non-local Spectral Transformer (NST) to emphasize the 3D characteristics of HSI for recovering. Moreover, inspired by the diverse expression of features in different stages and depths, the stage interaction is improved by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Experimental results on both simulated and real scenes exhibit the superior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art HSI reconstruction methods.

<p>Abstract:<br>In this article an innovative method for training regressive MLP networks is presented, which is not subject to local minima. The Error-Back-Propagation algorithm, proposed by William-Hinton-Rummelhart, has had the merit of favouring the development of machine learning techniques, which has permeated every branch of research and technology since the mid-1980s. This extraordinary success is largely due to the black-box approach, but this same factor was also seen as a limitation, as soon more challenging problems were approached. One of the most critical aspects of the training algorithms was that of local minima of the loss function, typically the mean squared error of the output on the training set. In fact, as the most popular training algorithms are driven by the derivatives of the loss function, there is no possibility to evaluate if a reached minimum is local or global. The algorithm presented in this paper avoids the problem of local minima, as the training is based on the properties of the distribution of the training set, or better on its image internal to the neural network. The performance of the algorithm is shown for a well-known benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to optimize the design of Reservoir Computing using Cellular Automata models for time series applications. Besides selecting the models’ hyperparameters, the proposed algorithm particularly solves the open problem of linear Cellular Automaton rule selection. The selection method pre-selects only a few promising candidate rules out of an exponentially growing rule space. When applied to relevant benchmark datasets, the selected rules achieve low errors, with the best rules being among the top 5% of the overall rule space. The algorithm was developed based on mathematical analysis of linear Cellular Automaton properties and is backed by almost one million experiments, adding up to a computational runtime of nearly one year. Comparisons to other state-of-the-art time series models show that the proposed Reservoir Computing using Cellular Automata models have lower computational complexity, at the same time, achieve lower errors. Hence, our approach reduces the time needed for training and hyperparameter optimization by up to several orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Modern data-driven and distributed learning frameworks deal with diverse massive data generated by clients spread across heterogeneous environments. Indeed, data heterogeneity is a major bottleneck in scaling up many distributed learning paradigms. In many settings however, heterogeneous data may be generated in clusters with shared structures, as is the case in several applications such as federated learning where a common latent variable governs the distribution of all the samples generated by a client. It is therefore natural to ask how the underlying clustered structures in distributed data can be exploited to improve learning schemes. In this paper, we tackle this question in the special case of estimating $d$-dimensional parameters of a two-component mixture of linear regressions problem where each of $m$ nodes generates $n$ samples with a shared latent variable. We employ the well-known Expectation-Maximization (EM) method to estimate the maximum likelihood parameters from $m$ batches of dependent samples each containing $n$ measurements. Discarding the clustered structure in the mixture model, EM is known to require $O(\log(mn&#x2F;d))$ iterations to reach the statistical accuracy of $O(\sqrt{d&#x2F;(mn)})$. In contrast, we show that if initialized properly, EM on the structured data requires only $O(1)$ iterations to reach the same statistical accuracy, as long as $m$ grows up as $e^{o(n)}$. Our analysis establishes and combines novel asymptotic optimization and generalization guarantees for population and empirical EM with dependent samples, which may be of independent interest.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The field of multi-object tracking has recently seen a renewed interest in the good old schema of tracking-by-detection, as its simplicity and strong priors spare it from the complex design and painful babysitting of tracking-by-attention approaches. In view of this, we aim at extending tracking-by-detection to multi-modal settings, where a comprehensive cost has to be computed from heterogeneous information e.g., 2D motion cues, visual appearance, and pose estimates. More precisely, we follow a case study where a rough estimate of 3D information is also available and must be merged with other traditional metrics (e.g., the IoU). To achieve that, recent approaches resort to either simple rules or complex heuristics to balance the contribution of each cost. However, i) they require careful tuning of tailored hyperparameters on a hold-out set, and ii) they imply these costs to be independent, which does not hold in reality. We address these issues by building upon an elegant probabilistic formulation, which considers the cost of a candidate association as the negative log-likelihood yielded by a deep density estimator, trained to model the conditional joint probability distribution of correct associations. Our experiments, conducted on both simulated and real benchmarks, show that our approach consistently enhances the performance of several tracking-by-detection algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We explore element-wise convex combinations of two permutation-aligned neural network parameter vectors $\Theta_A$ and $\Theta_B$ of size $d$. We conduct extensive experiments by examining various distributions of such model combinations parametrized by elements of the hypercube $[0,1]^{d}$ and its vicinity. Our findings reveal that broad regions of the hypercube form surfaces of low loss values, indicating that the notion of linear mode connectivity extends to a more general phenomenon which we call mode combinability. We also make several novel observations regarding linear mode connectivity and model re-basin. We demonstrate a transitivity property: two models re-based to a common third model are also linear mode connected, and a robustness property: even with significant perturbations of the neuron matchings the resulting combinations continue to form a working model. Moreover, we analyze the functional and weight similarity of model combinations and show that such combinations are non-vacuous in the sense that there are significant functional differences between the resulting models.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Automatically disentangling an author’s style from the content of their writing is a longstanding and possibly insurmountable problem in computational linguistics. At the same time, the availability of large text corpora furnished with author labels has recently enabled learning authorship representations in a purely data-driven manner for authorship attribution, a task that ostensibly depends to a greater extent on encoding writing style than encoding content. However, success on this surrogate task does not ensure that such representations capture writing style since authorship could also be correlated with other latent variables, such as topic. In an effort to better understand the nature of the information these representations convey, and specifically to validate the hypothesis that they chiefly encode writing style, we systematically probe these representations through a series of targeted experiments. The results of these experiments suggest that representations learned for the surrogate authorship prediction task are indeed sensitive to writing style. As a consequence, authorship representations may be expected to be robust to certain kinds of data shift, such as topic drift over time. Additionally, our findings may open the door to downstream applications that require stylistic representations, such as style transfer.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various NLP tasks. However, previous works have shown these models are sensitive towards prompt wording, and few-shot demonstrations and their order, posing challenges to fair assessment of these models. As these models become more powerful, it becomes imperative to understand and address these limitations. In this paper, we focus on LLMs robustness on the task of multiple-choice questions – commonly adopted task to study reasoning and fact-retrieving capability of LLMs. Investigating the sensitivity of LLMs towards the order of options in multiple-choice questions, we demonstrate a considerable performance gap of approximately 13% to 75% in LLMs on different benchmarks, when answer options are reordered, even when using demonstrations in a few-shot setting. Through a detailed analysis, we conjecture that this sensitivity arises when LLMs are uncertain about the prediction between the top-2&#x2F;3 choices, and specific options placements may favor certain prediction between those top choices depending on the question caused by positional bias. We also identify patterns in top-2 choices that amplify or mitigate the model’s bias toward option placement. We found that for amplifying bias, the optimal strategy involves positioning the top two choices as the first and last options. Conversely, to mitigate bias, we recommend placing these choices among the adjacent options. To validate our conjecture, we conduct various experiments and adopt two approaches to calibrate LLMs’ predictions, leading to up to 8 percentage points improvement across different models and benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Improving the reliability of deployed machine learning systems often involves developing methods to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. However, existing research often narrowly focuses on samples from classes that are absent from the training set, neglecting other types of plausible distribution shifts. This limitation reduces the applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios, where systems encounter a wide variety of anomalous inputs. In this study, we categorize five distinct types of distribution shifts and critically evaluate the performance of recent OOD detection methods on each of them. We publicly release our benchmark under the name BROAD (Benchmarking Resilience Over Anomaly Diversity). Our findings reveal that while these methods excel in detecting unknown classes, their performance is inconsistent when encountering other types of distribution shifts. In other words, they only reliably detect unexpected inputs that they have been specifically designed to expect. As a first step toward broad OOD detection, we learn a generative model of existing detection scores with a Gaussian mixture. By doing so, we present an ensemble approach that offers a more consistent and comprehensive solution for broad OOD detection, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. Our code to download BROAD and reproduce our experiments is publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Decision trees are highly interpretable models for solving classification problems in machine learning (ML). The standard ML algorithms for training decision trees are fast but generate suboptimal trees in terms of accuracy. Other discrete optimization models in the literature address the optimality problem but only work well on relatively small datasets. \cite{firat2020column} proposed a column-generation-based heuristic approach for learning decision trees. This approach improves scalability and can work with large datasets. In this paper, we describe improvements to this column generation approach. First, we modify the subproblem model to significantly reduce the number of subproblems in multiclass classification instances. Next, we show that the data-dependent constraints in the master problem are implied, and use them as cutting planes. Furthermore, we describe a separation model to generate data points for which the linear programming relaxation solution violates their corresponding constraints. We conclude by presenting computational results that show that these modifications result in better scalability.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Federated learning (FL) inevitably confronts the challenge of system heterogeneity in practical scenarios. To enhance the capabilities of most model-homogeneous FL methods in handling system heterogeneity, we propose a training scheme that can extend their capabilities to cope with this challenge. In this paper, we commence our study with a detailed exploration of homogeneous and heterogeneous FL settings and discover three key observations: (1) a positive correlation between client performance and layer similarities, (2) higher similarities in the shallow layers in contrast to the deep layers, and (3) the smoother gradients distributions indicate the higher layer similarities. Building upon these observations, we propose InCo Aggregation that leverags internal cross-layer gradients, a mixture of gradients from shallow and deep layers within a server model, to augment the similarity in the deep layers without requiring additional communication between clients. Furthermore, our methods can be tailored to accommodate model-homogeneous FL methods such as FedAvg, FedProx, FedNova, Scaffold, and MOON, to expand their capabilities to handle the system heterogeneity. Copious experimental results validate the effectiveness of InCo Aggregation, spotlighting internal cross-layer gradients as a promising avenue to enhance the performance in heterogenous FL.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to build classification models from data streams. At each step of the CIL process, new classes must be integrated into the model. Due to catastrophic forgetting, CIL is particularly challenging when examples from past classes cannot be stored, the case on which we focus here. To date, most approaches are based exclusively on the target dataset of the CIL process. However, the use of models pre-trained in a self-supervised way on large amounts of data has recently gained momentum. The initial model of the CIL process may only use the first batch of the target dataset, or also use pre-trained weights obtained on an auxiliary dataset. The choice between these two initial learning strategies can significantly influence the performance of the incremental learning model, but has not yet been studied in depth. Performance is also influenced by the choice of the CIL algorithm, the neural architecture, the nature of the target task, the distribution of classes in the stream and the number of examples available for learning. We conduct a comprehensive experimental study to assess the roles of these factors. We present a statistical analysis framework that quantifies the relative contribution of each factor to incremental performance. Our main finding is that the initial training strategy is the dominant factor influencing the average incremental accuracy, but that the choice of CIL algorithm is more important in preventing forgetting. Based on this analysis, we propose practical recommendations for choosing the right initial training strategy for a given incremental learning use case. These recommendations are intended to facilitate the practical deployment of incremental learning.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Learning meaningful representations is at the heart of many tasks in the field of modern machine learning. Recently, a lot of methods were introduced that allow learning of image representations without supervision. These representations can then be used in downstream tasks like classification or object detection. The quality of these representations is close to supervised learning, while no labeled images are needed. This survey paper provides a comprehensive review of these methods in a unified notation, points out similarities and differences of these methods, and proposes a taxonomy which sets these methods in relation to each other. Furthermore, our survey summarizes the most-recent experimental results reported in the literature in form of a meta-study. Our survey is intended as a starting point for researchers and practitioners who want to dive into the field of representation learning.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Self-supervised pretraining (SSP) has emerged as a popular technique in machine learning, enabling the extraction of meaningful feature representations without labelled data. In the realm of computer vision, pretrained vision transformers (ViTs) have played a pivotal role in advancing transfer learning. Nonetheless, the escalating cost of finetuning these large models has posed a challenge due to the explosion of model size. This study endeavours to evaluate the effectiveness of pure self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques in computer vision tasks, obviating the need for finetuning, with the intention of emulating human-like capabilities in generalisation and recognition of unseen objects. To this end, we propose an evaluation protocol for zero-shot segmentation based on a prompting patch. Given a point on the target object as a prompt, the algorithm calculates the similarity map between the selected patch and other patches, upon that, a simple thresholding is applied to segment the target. Another evaluation is intra-object and inter-object similarity to gauge discriminatory ability of SSP ViTs. Insights from zero-shot segmentation from prompting and discriminatory abilities of SSP led to the design of a simple SSP approach, termed MMC. This approaches combines Masked image modelling for encouraging similarity of local features, Momentum based self-distillation for transferring semantics from global to local features, and global Contrast for promoting semantics of global features, to enhance discriminative representations of SSP ViTs. Consequently, our proposed method significantly reduces the overlap of intra-object and inter-object similarities, thereby facilitating effective object segmentation within an image. Our experiments reveal that MMC delivers top-tier results in zero-shot semantic segmentation across various datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The machine learning modeling process conventionally culminates in selecting a single model that maximizes a selected performance metric. However, this approach leads to abandoning a more profound analysis of slightly inferior models. Particularly in medical and healthcare studies, where the objective extends beyond predictions to valuable insight generation, relying solely on performance metrics can result in misleading or incomplete conclusions. This problem is particularly pertinent when dealing with a set of models with performance close to maximum one, known as $\textit{Rashomon set}$. Such a set can be numerous and may contain models describing the data in a different way, which calls for comprehensive analysis. This paper introduces a novel process to explore Rashomon set models, extending the conventional modeling approach. The cornerstone is the identification of the most different models within the Rashomon set, facilitated by the introduced $\texttt{Rashomon_DETECT}$ algorithm. This algorithm compares profiles illustrating prediction dependencies on variable values generated by eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques. To quantify differences in variable effects among models, we introduce the Profile Disparity Index (PDI) based on measures from functional data analysis. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we showcase its application in predicting survival among hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) patients - a foundational case study. Additionally, we benchmark our approach on other medical data sets, demonstrating its versatility and utility in various contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>A person’s gender is a crucial piece of information when performing research across a wide range of scientific disciplines, such as medicine, sociology, political science, and economics, to name a few. However, in increasing instances, especially given the proliferation of big data, gender information is not readily available. In such cases researchers need to infer gender from readily available information, primarily from persons’ names. While inferring gender from name may raise some ethical questions, the lack of viable alternatives means that researchers have to resort to such approaches when the goal justifies the means - in the majority of such studies the goal is to examine patterns and determinants of gender disparities. The necessity of name-to-gender inference has generated an ever-growing domain of algorithmic approaches and software products. These approaches have been used throughout the world in academia, industry, governmental and non-governmental organizations. Nevertheless, the existing approaches have yet to be systematically evaluated and compared, making it challenging to determine the optimal approach for future research. In this work, we conducted a large scale performance evaluation of existing approaches for name-to-gender inference. Analysis are performed using a variety of large annotated datasets of names. We further propose two new hybrid approaches that achieve better performance than any single existing approach.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The Potential Outcome Framework (POF) plays a prominent role in the field of causal inference. Most causal inference models based on the POF (CIMs-B-POF) are designed for eliminating confounding bias and default to an underlying assumption of Confounding Covariates. This assumption posits that the covariates consist solely of confounders. However, the assumption of Confounding Covariates is challenging to maintain in practice, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional covariates. While certain methods have been proposed to differentiate the distinct components of covariates prior to conducting causal inference, the consequences of treating non-confounding covariates as confounders remain unclear. This ambiguity poses a potential risk when applying the CIMs-B-POF in practical scenarios. In this paper, we present a unified graphical framework for the CIMs-B-POF, which greatly enhances the comprehension of these models’ underlying principles. Using this graphical framework, we quantitatively analyze the extent to which the inference performance of CIMs-B-POF is influenced when incorporating various types of non-confounding covariates, such as instrumental variables, mediators, colliders, and adjustment variables. The key findings are: in the task of eliminating confounding bias, the optimal scenario is for the covariates to exclusively encompass confounders; in the subsequent task of inferring counterfactual outcomes, the adjustment variables contribute to more accurate inferences. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted on synthetic datasets consistently validate these theoretical conclusions.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Vision transformers have shown unprecedented levels of performance in tackling various visual perception tasks in recent years. However, the architectural and computational complexity of such network architectures have made them challenging to deploy in real-world applications with high-throughput, low-memory requirements. As such, there has been significant research recently on the design of efficient vision transformer architectures. In this study, we explore the generation of fast vision transformer architecture designs via generative architecture search (GAS) to achieve a strong balance between accuracy and architectural and computational efficiency. Through this generative architecture search process, we create TurboViT, a highly efficient hierarchical vision transformer architecture design that is generated around mask unit attention and Q-pooling design patterns. The resulting TurboViT architecture design achieves significantly lower architectural computational complexity (&gt;2.47$\times$ smaller than FasterViT-0 while achieving same accuracy) and computational complexity (&gt;3.4$\times$ fewer FLOPs and 0.9% higher accuracy than MobileViT2-2.0) when compared to 10 other state-of-the-art efficient vision transformer network architecture designs within a similar range of accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset. Furthermore, TurboViT demonstrated strong inference latency and throughput in both low-latency and batch processing scenarios (&gt;3.21$\times$ lower latency and &gt;3.18$\times$ higher throughput compared to FasterViT-0 for low-latency scenario). These promising results demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging generative architecture search for generating efficient transformer architecture designs for high-throughput scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Given the escalating risks of malicious attacks in the finance sector and the consequential severe damage, a thorough understanding of adversarial strategies and robust defense mechanisms for machine learning models is critical. The threat becomes even more severe with the increased adoption in banks more accurate, but potentially fragile neural networks. We aim to investigate the current state and dynamics of adversarial attacks and defenses for neural network models that use sequential financial data as the input.   To achieve this goal, we have designed a competition that allows realistic and detailed investigation of problems in modern financial transaction data. The participants compete directly against each other, so possible attacks and defenses are examined in close-to-real-life conditions. Our main contributions are the analysis of the competition dynamics that answers the questions on how important it is to conceal a model from malicious users, how long does it take to break it, and what techniques one should use to make it more robust, and introduction additional way to attack models or increase their robustness.   Our analysis continues with a meta-study on the used approaches with their power, numerical experiments, and accompanied ablations studies. We show that the developed attacks and defenses outperform existing alternatives from the literature while being practical in terms of execution, proving the validity of the competition as a tool for uncovering vulnerabilities of machine learning models and mitigating them in various domains.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We address the problem of learning Deep Learning Radiomics (DLR) that are not redundant with Hand-Crafted Radiomics (HCR). To do so, we extract DLR features using a VAE while enforcing their independence with HCR features by minimizing their mutual information. The resulting DLR features can be combined with hand-crafted ones and leveraged by a classifier to predict early markers of cancer. We illustrate our method on four early markers of pancreatic cancer and validate it on a large independent test set. Our results highlight the value of combining non-redundant DLR and HCR features, as evidenced by an improvement in the Area Under the Curve compared to baseline methods that do not address redundancy or solely rely on HCR features.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The development of fair and ethical AI systems requires careful consideration of bias mitigation, an area often overlooked or ignored. In this study, we introduce a novel and efficient approach for addressing biases called Targeted Data Augmentation (TDA), which leverages classical data augmentation techniques to tackle the pressing issue of bias in data and models. Unlike the laborious task of removing biases, our method proposes to insert biases instead, resulting in improved performance. To identify biases, we annotated two diverse datasets: a dataset of clinical skin lesions and a dataset of male and female faces. These bias annotations are published for the first time in this study, providing a valuable resource for future research. Through Counterfactual Bias Insertion, we discovered that biases associated with the frame, ruler, and glasses had a significant impact on models. By randomly introducing biases during training, we mitigated these biases and achieved a substantial decrease in bias measures, ranging from two-fold to more than 50-fold, while maintaining a negligible increase in the error rate.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Measures of algorithmic fairness are usually discussed in the context of binary decisions. We extend the approach to continuous scores. So far, ROC-based measures have mainly been suggested for this purpose. Other existing methods depend heavily on the distribution of scores, are unsuitable for ranking tasks, or their effect sizes are not interpretable. Here, we propose a distributionally invariant version of fairness measures for continuous scores with a reasonable interpretation based on the Wasserstein distance. Our measures are easily computable and well suited for quantifying and interpreting the strength of group disparities as well as for comparing biases across different models, datasets, or time points. We derive a link between the different families of existing fairness measures for scores and show that the proposed distributionally invariant fairness measures outperform ROC-based fairness measures because they are more explicit and can quantify significant biases that ROC-based fairness measures miss. Finally, we demonstrate their effectiveness through experiments on the most commonly used fairness benchmark datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Modeling long-term context in videos is crucial for many fine-grained tasks including temporal action segmentation. An interesting question that is still open is how much long-term temporal context is needed for optimal performance. While transformers can model the long-term context of a video, this becomes computationally prohibitive for long videos. Recent works on temporal action segmentation thus combine temporal convolutional networks with self-attentions that are computed only for a local temporal window. While these approaches show good results, their performance is limited by their inability to capture the full context of a video. In this work, we try to answer how much long-term temporal context is required for temporal action segmentation by introducing a transformer-based model that leverages sparse attention to capture the full context of a video. We compare our model with the current state of the art on three datasets for temporal action segmentation, namely 50Salads, Breakfast, and Assembly101.

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper presents a novel, interdisciplinary study that leverages a Machine Learning (ML) assisted framework to explore the geometry of affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties (ADLV). The primary objective is to investigate the nonemptiness pattern, dimension and enumeration of irreducible components of ADLV. Our proposed framework demonstrates a recursive pipeline of data generation, model training, pattern analysis, and human examination, presenting an intricate interplay between ML and pure mathematical research. Notably, our data-generation process is nuanced, emphasizing the selection of meaningful subsets and appropriate feature sets. We demonstrate that this framework has a potential to accelerate pure mathematical research, leading to the discovery of new conjectures and promising research directions that could otherwise take significant time to uncover. We rediscover the virtual dimension formula and provide a full mathematical proof of a newly identified problem concerning a certain lower bound of dimension. Furthermore, we extend an open invitation to the readers by providing the source code for computing ADLV and the ML models, promoting further explorations. This paper concludes by sharing valuable experiences and highlighting lessons learned from this collaboration.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Emotion prediction is the field of study to understand human emotions. Existing methods focus on modalities like text, audio, facial expressions, etc., which could be private to the user. Emotion can be derived from the subject’s psychological data as well. Various approaches that employ combinations of physiological sensors for emotion recognition have been proposed. Yet, not all sensors are simple to use and handy for individuals in their daily lives. Thus, we propose a system to predict user emotion using smartwatch sensors. We design a framework to collect ground truth in real-time utilizing a mix of English and regional language-based videos to invoke emotions in participants and collect the data. Further, we modeled the problem as binary classification due to the limited dataset size and experimented with multiple machine-learning models. We also did an ablation study to understand the impact of features including Heart Rate, Accelerometer, and Gyroscope sensor data on mood. From the experimental results, Multi-Layer Perceptron has shown a maximum accuracy of 93.75 percent for pleasant-unpleasant (high&#x2F;low valence classification) moods.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Exploration strategies in continuous action space are often heuristic due to the infinite actions, and these kinds of methods cannot derive a general conclusion. In prior work, it has been shown that policy-based exploration is beneficial for continuous action space in deterministic policy reinforcement learning(DPRL). However, policy-based exploration in DPRL has two prominent issues: aimless exploration and policy divergence, and the policy gradient for exploration is only sometimes helpful due to inaccurate estimation. Based on the double-Q function framework, we introduce a novel exploration strategy to mitigate these issues, separate from the policy gradient. We first propose the greedy Q softmax update schema for Q value update. The expected Q value is derived by weighted summing the conservative Q value over actions, and the weight is the corresponding greedy Q value. Greedy Q takes the maximum value of the two Q functions, and conservative Q takes the minimum value of the two different Q functions. For practicality, this theoretical basis is then extended to allow us to combine action exploration with the Q value update, except for the premise that we have a surrogate policy that behaves like this exploration policy. In practice, we construct such an exploration policy with a few sampled actions, and to meet the premise, we learn such a surrogate policy by minimizing the KL divergence between the target policy and the exploration policy constructed by the conservative Q. We evaluate our method on the Mujoco benchmark and demonstrate superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods across various environments, particularly in the most complex Humanoid environment.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Building AIs with adaptive behaviors in human-AI cooperation stands as a pivotal focus in AGI research. Current methods for developing cooperative agents predominantly rely on learning-based methods, where policy generalization heavily hinges on past interactions with specific teammates. These approaches constrain the agent’s capacity to recalibrate its strategy when confronted with novel teammates. We propose \textbf{ProAgent}, a novel framework that harnesses large language models (LLMs) to fashion a \textit{pro}active \textit{agent} empowered with the ability to anticipate teammates’ forthcoming decisions and formulate enhanced plans for itself. ProAgent excels at cooperative reasoning with the capacity to dynamically adapt its behavior to enhance collaborative efforts with teammates. Moreover, the ProAgent framework exhibits a high degree of modularity and interpretability, facilitating seamless integration to address a wide array of coordination scenarios. Experimental evaluations conducted within the framework of \textit{Overcook-AI} unveil the remarkable performance superiority of ProAgent, outperforming five methods based on self-play and population-based training in cooperation with AI agents. Further, when cooperating with human proxy models, its performance exhibits an average improvement exceeding 10% compared to the current state-of-the-art, COLE. The advancement was consistently observed across diverse scenarios involving interactions with both AI agents of varying characteristics and human counterparts. These findings inspire future research for human-robot collaborations.

<p>Abstract:<br>Sequence modelling approaches for epigenetic profile prediction have recently expanded in terms of sequence length, model size, and profile diversity. However, current models cannot infer on many experimentally feasible tissue and assay pairs due to poor usage of contextual information, limiting $\textit{in silico}$ understanding of regulatory genomics. We demonstrate that strong correlation can be achieved across a large range of experimental conditions by integrating tissue and assay embeddings into a Contextualised Genomic Network (CGN). In contrast to previous approaches, we enhance long-range sequence embeddings with contextual information in the input space, rather than expanding the output space. We exhibit the efficacy of our approach across a broad set of epigenetic profiles and provide the first insights into the effect of genetic variants on epigenetic sequence model training. Our general approach to context integration exceeds state of the art in multiple settings while employing a more rigorous validation procedure.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>As a distributed machine learning paradigm, Federated Learning (FL) enables large-scale clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing their raw data. However, due to the lack of data auditing for untrusted clients, FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, especially backdoor attacks. By using poisoned data for local training or directly changing the model parameters, attackers can easily inject backdoors into the model, which can trigger the model to make misclassification of targeted patterns in images. To address these issues, we propose a novel data-free trigger-generation-based defense approach based on the two characteristics of backdoor attacks: i) triggers are learned faster than normal knowledge, and ii) trigger patterns have a greater effect on image classification than normal class patterns. Our approach generates the images with newly learned knowledge by identifying the differences between the old and new global models, and filters trigger images by evaluating the effect of these generated images. By using these trigger images, our approach eliminates poisoned models to ensure the updated global model is benign. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can defend against almost all the existing types of backdoor attacks and outperform all the seven state-of-the-art defense methods with both IID and non-IID scenarios. Especially, our approach can successfully defend against the backdoor attack even when 80% of the clients are malicious.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) gained importance in many industrial applications. State-of-the-art solutions heavily rely on external infrastructures and are subject to potential privacy compromises, external information requirements, and assumptions, that make it unfavorable for environments demanding privacy and prolonged functionality. In certain environments deploying supplementary infrastructures for indoor positioning could be infeasible and expensive. Recent developments in machine learning (ML) offer solutions to address these limitations relying only on the data from onboard sensors of IoT devices. However, it is unclear which model fits best considering the resource constraints of IoT devices. This paper presents a machine learning-based indoor positioning system, using motion and ambient sensors, to localize a moving entity in privacy concerned factory environments. The problem is formulated as a multivariate time series classification (MTSC) and a comparative analysis of different machine learning models is conducted in order to address it. We introduce a novel time series dataset emulating the assembly lines of a factory. This dataset is utilized to assess and compare the selected models in terms of accuracy, memory footprint and inference speed. The results illustrate that all evaluated models can achieve accuracies above 80 %. CNN-1D shows the most balanced performance, followed by MLP. DT was found to have the lowest memory footprint and inference latency, indicating its potential for a deployment in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Unsupervised GAD methods assume the lack of anomaly labels, i.e., whether a node is anomalous or not. One common observation we made from previous unsupervised methods is that they not only assume the absence of such anomaly labels, but also the absence of class labels (the class a node belongs to used in a general node classification task). In this work, we study the utility of class labels for unsupervised GAD; in particular, how they enhance the detection of structural anomalies. To this end, we propose a Class Label-aware Graph Anomaly Detection framework (CLAD) that utilizes a limited amount of labeled nodes to enhance the performance of unsupervised GAD. Extensive experiments on ten datasets demonstrate the superior performance of CLAD in comparison to existing unsupervised GAD methods, even in the absence of ground-truth class label information.

<p>Abstract:<br>Determining the degree of confidence of deep learning model in its prediction is an open problem in the field of natural language processing. Most of the classical methods for uncertainty estimation are quite weak for text classification models. We set the task of obtaining an uncertainty estimate for neural networks based on the Transformer architecture. A key feature of such mo-dels is the attention mechanism, which supports the information flow between the hidden representations of tokens in the neural network. We explore the formed relationships between internal representations using Topological Data Analysis methods and utilize them to predict model’s confidence. In this paper, we propose a method for uncertainty estimation based on the topological properties of the attention mechanism and compare it with classical methods. As a result, the proposed algorithm surpasses the existing methods in quality and opens up a new area of application of the attention mechanism, but requires the selection of topological features.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We investigate the concept of network momentum, a novel trading signal derived from momentum spillover across assets. Initially observed within the confines of pairwise economic and fundamental ties, such as the stock-bond connection of the same company and stocks linked through supply-demand chains, momentum spillover implies a propagation of momentum risk premium from one asset to another. The similarity of momentum risk premium, exemplified by co-movement patterns, has been spotted across multiple asset classes including commodities, equities, bonds and currencies. However, studying the network effect of momentum spillover across these classes has been challenging due to a lack of readily available common characteristics or economic ties beyond the company level. In this paper, we explore the interconnections of momentum features across a diverse range of 64 continuous future contracts spanning these four classes. We utilise a linear and interpretable graph learning model with minimal assumptions to reveal the intricacies of the momentum spillover network. By leveraging the learned networks, we construct a network momentum strategy that exhibits a Sharpe ratio of 1.5 and an annual return of 22%, after volatility scaling, from 2000 to 2022. This paper pioneers the examination of momentum spillover across multiple asset classes using only pricing data, presents a multi-asset investment strategy based on network momentum, and underscores the effectiveness of this strategy through robust empirical analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The quality of a wood log in the wood industry depends heavily on the presence of both outer and inner defects, including inner knots that are a result of the growth of tree branches. Today, locating the inner knots require the use of expensive equipment such as X-ray scanners. In this paper, we address the task of predicting the location of inner defects from the outer shape of the logs. The dataset is built by extracting both the contours and the knots with X-ray measurements. We propose to solve this binary segmentation task by leveraging convolutional recurrent neural networks. Once the neural network is trained, inference can be performed from the outer shape measured with cheap devices such as laser profilers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on fir and spruce tree species and perform ablation on the recurrence to demonstrate its importance.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Understanding the dynamics of large quantum systems is hindered by the curse of dimensionality. Statistical learning offers new possibilities in this regime by neural-network protocols and classical shadows, while both methods have limitations: the former is plagued by the predictive uncertainty and the latter lacks the generalization ability. Here we propose a data-centric learning paradigm combining the strength of these two approaches to facilitate diverse quantum system learning (QSL) tasks. Particularly, our paradigm utilizes classical shadows along with other easily obtainable information of quantum systems to create the training dataset, which is then learnt by neural networks to unveil the underlying mapping rule of the explored QSL problem. Capitalizing on the generalization power of neural networks, this paradigm can be trained offline and excel at predicting previously unseen systems at the inference stage, even with few state copies. Besides, it inherits the characteristic of classical shadows, enabling memory-efficient storage and faithful prediction. These features underscore the immense potential of the proposed data-centric approach in discovering novel and large-scale quantum systems. For concreteness, we present the instantiation of our paradigm in quantum state tomography and direct fidelity estimation tasks and conduct numerical analysis up to 60 qubits. Our work showcases the profound prospects of data-centric artificial intelligence to advance QSL in a faithful and generalizable manner.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Popularity bias is a widespread problem in the field of recommender systems, where popular items tend to dominate recommendation results. In this work, we propose ‘Test Time Embedding Normalization’ as a simple yet effective strategy for mitigating popularity bias, which surpasses the performance of the previous mitigation approaches by a significant margin. Our approach utilizes the normalized item embedding during the inference stage to control the influence of embedding magnitude, which is highly correlated with item popularity. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method combined with the sampled softmax loss effectively reduces popularity bias compare to previous approaches for bias mitigation. We further investigate the relationship between user and item embeddings and find that the angular similarity between embeddings distinguishes preferable and non-preferable items regardless of their popularity. The analysis explains the mechanism behind the success of our approach in eliminating the impact of popularity bias.

<p>Abstract:<br>Motivated by the challenges of the Digital Ancient Near Eastern Studies (DANES) community, we develop digital tools for processing cuneiform script being a 3D script imprinted into clay tablets used for more than three millennia and at least eight major languages. It consists of thousands of characters that have changed over time and space. Photographs are the most common representations usable for machine learning, while ink drawings are prone to interpretation. Best suited 3D datasets that are becoming available. We created and used the HeiCuBeDa and MaiCuBeDa datasets, which consist of around 500 annotated tablets. For our novel OCR-like approach to mixed image data, we provide an additional mapping tool for transferring annotations between 3D renderings and photographs. Our sign localization uses a RepPoints detector to predict the locations of characters as bounding boxes. We use image data from GigaMesh’s MSII (curvature, see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gigamesh.eu/">https://gigamesh.eu</a>) based rendering, Phong-shaded 3D models, and photographs as well as illumination augmentation. The results show that using rendered 3D images for sign detection performs better than other work on photographs. In addition, our approach gives reasonably good results for photographs only, while it is best used for mixed datasets. More importantly, the Phong renderings, and especially the MSII renderings, improve the results on photographs, which is the largest dataset on a global scale.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has gained significant popularity due to its success in various cooperative multi-agent tasks. However, exploration still remains a challenging problem in MARL due to the partial observability of the agents and the exploration space that can grow exponentially as the number of agents increases. Firstly, in order to address the scalability issue of the exploration space, we define a formation-based equivalence relation on the exploration space and aim to reduce the search space by exploring only meaningful states in different formations. Then, we propose a novel formation-aware exploration (FoX) framework that encourages partially observable agents to visit the states in diverse formations by guiding them to be well aware of their current formation solely based on their own observations. Numerical results show that the proposed FoX framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art MARL algorithms on Google Research Football (GRF) and sparse Starcraft II multi-agent challenge (SMAC) tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Quantum-inspired Machine Learning (QiML) is a burgeoning field, receiving global attention from researchers for its potential to leverage principles of quantum mechanics within classical computational frameworks. However, current review literature often presents a superficial exploration of QiML, focusing instead on the broader Quantum Machine Learning (QML) field. In response to this gap, this survey provides an integrated and comprehensive examination of QiML, exploring QiML’s diverse research domains including tensor network simulations, dequantized algorithms, and others, showcasing recent advancements, practical applications, and illuminating potential future research avenues. Further, a concrete definition of QiML is established by analyzing various prior interpretations of the term and their inherent ambiguities. As QiML continues to evolve, we anticipate a wealth of future developments drawing from quantum mechanics, quantum computing, and classical machine learning, enriching the field further. This survey serves as a guide for researchers and practitioners alike, providing a holistic understanding of QiML’s current landscape and future directions.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The robust constrained Markov decision process (RCMDP) is a recent task-modelling framework for reinforcement learning that incorporates behavioural constraints and that provides robustness to errors in the transition dynamics model through the use of an uncertainty set. Simulating RCMDPs requires computing the worst-case dynamics based on value estimates for each state, an approach which has previously been used in the Robust Constrained Policy Gradient (RCPG). Highlighting potential downsides of RCPG such as not robustifying the full constrained objective and the lack of incremental learning, this paper introduces two algorithms, called RCPG with Robust Lagrangian and Adversarial RCPG. RCPG with Robust Lagrangian modifies RCPG by taking the worst-case dynamics based on the Lagrangian rather than either the value or the constraint. Adversarial RCPG also formulates the worst-case dynamics based on the Lagrangian but learns this directly and incrementally as an adversarial policy through gradient descent rather than indirectly and abruptly through constrained optimisation on a sorted value list. A theoretical analysis first derives the Lagrangian policy gradient for the policy optimisation of both proposed algorithms and then the adversarial policy gradient to learn the adversary for Adversarial RCPG. Empirical experiments injecting perturbations in inventory management and safe navigation tasks demonstrate the competitive performance of both algorithms compared to traditional RCPG variants as well as non-robust and non-constrained ablations. In particular, Adversarial RCPG ranks among the top two performing algorithms on all tests.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>No-regret algorithms are popular for learning Nash equilibrium (NE) in two-player zero-sum normal-form games (NFGs) and extensive-form games (EFGs). Many recent works consider the last-iterate convergence no-regret algorithms. Among them, the two most famous algorithms are Optimistic Gradient Descent Ascent (OGDA) and Optimistic Multiplicative Weight Update (OMWU). However, OGDA has high per-iteration complexity. OMWU exhibits a lower per-iteration complexity but poorer empirical performance, and its convergence holds only when NE is unique. Recent works propose a Reward Transformation (RT) framework for MWU, which removes the uniqueness condition and achieves competitive performance with OMWU. Unfortunately, RT-based algorithms perform worse than OGDA under the same number of iterations, and their convergence guarantee is based on the continuous-time feedback assumption, which does not hold in most scenarios. To address these issues, we provide a closer analysis of the RT framework, which holds for both continuous and discrete-time feedback. We demonstrate that the essence of the RT framework is to transform the problem of learning NE in the original game into a series of strongly convex-concave optimization problems (SCCPs). We show that the bottleneck of RT-based algorithms is the speed of solving SCCPs. To improve the their empirical performance, we design a novel transformation method to enable the SCCPs can be solved by Regret Matching+ (RM+), a no-regret algorithm with better empirical performance, resulting in Reward Transformation RM+ (RTRM+). RTRM+ enjoys last-iterate convergence under the discrete-time feedback setting. Using the counterfactual regret decomposition framework, we propose Reward Transformation CFR+ (RTCFR+) to extend RTRM+ to EFGs. Experimental results show that our algorithms significantly outperform existing last-iterate convergence algorithms and RM+ (CFR+).</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Current research on bias in machine learning often focuses on fairness, while overlooking the roots or causes of bias. However, bias was originally defined as a “systematic error,” often caused by humans at different stages of the research process. This article aims to bridge the gap between past literature on bias in research by providing taxonomy for potential sources of bias and errors in data and models. The paper focus on bias in machine learning pipelines. Survey analyses over forty potential sources of bias in the machine learning (ML) pipeline, providing clear examples for each. By understanding the sources and consequences of bias in machine learning, better methods can be developed for its detecting and mitigating, leading to fairer, more transparent, and more accurate ML models.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Fault diagnosis is an essential component in process supervision. Indeed, it determines which kind of fault has occurred, given that it has been previously detected, allowing for appropriate intervention. Automatic fault diagnosis systems use machine learning for predicting the fault type from sensor readings. Nonetheless, these models are sensible to changes in the data distributions, which may be caused by changes in the monitored process, such as changes in the mode of operation. This scenario is known as Cross-Domain Fault Diagnosis (CDFD). We provide an extensive comparison of single and multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation (SSDA and MSDA respectively) algorithms for CDFD. We study these methods in the context of the Tennessee-Eastmann Process, a widely used benchmark in the chemical industry. We show that using multiple domains during training has a positive effect, even when no adaptation is employed. As such, the MSDA baseline improves over the SSDA baseline classification accuracy by 23% on average. In addition, under the multiple-sources scenario, we improve classification accuracy of the no adaptation setting by 8.4% on average.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Wav2vec2 has achieved success in applying Transformer architecture and self-supervised learning to speech recognition. Recently, these have come to be used not only for speech recognition but also for the entire speech processing. This paper introduces an effective end-to-end speaker identification model applied Transformer-based contextual model. We explored the relationship between the parameters and the performance in order to discern the structure of an effective model. Furthermore, we propose a pooling method, Temporal Gate Pooling, with powerful learning ability for speaker identification. We applied Conformer as encoder and BEST-RQ for pre-training and conducted an evaluation utilizing the speaker identification of VoxCeleb1. The proposed method has achieved an accuracy of 85.9% with 28.5M parameters, demonstrating comparable precision to wav2vec2 with 317.7M parameters.

<p>Abstract:<br>In their seminal work, Broder \textit{et. al.}~\citep{BroderCFM98} introduces the $\mathrm{minHash}$ algorithm that computes a low-dimensional sketch of high-dimensional binary data that closely approximates pairwise Jaccard similarity. Since its invention, $\mathrm{minHash}$ has been commonly used by practitioners in various big data applications. Further, the data is dynamic in many real-life scenarios, and their feature sets evolve over time. We consider the case when features are dynamically inserted and deleted in the dataset. We note that a naive solution to this problem is to repeatedly recompute $\mathrm{minHash}$ with respect to the updated dimension. However, this is an expensive task as it requires generating fresh random permutations. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic study of $\mathrm{minHash}$ is recorded in the context of dynamic insertion and deletion of features. In this work, we initiate this study and suggest algorithms that make the $\mathrm{minHash}$ sketches adaptable to the dynamic insertion and deletion of features. We show a rigorous theoretical analysis of our algorithms and complement it with extensive experiments on several real-world datasets. Empirically we observe a significant speed-up in the running time while simultaneously offering comparable performance with respect to running $\mathrm{minHash}$ from scratch. Our proposal is efficient, accurate, and easy to implement in practice.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The field of women’s endocrinology has trailed behind data-driven medical solutions, largely due to concerns over the privacy of patient data. Valuable datapoints about hormone levels or menstrual cycling could expose patients who suffer from comorbidities or terminate a pregnancy, violating their privacy. We explore the application of Federated Learning (FL) to predict the optimal drug for patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a serious hormonal disorder impacting millions of women worldwide, yet it’s poorly understood and its research is stunted by a lack of patient data. We demonstrate that a variety of FL approaches succeed on a synthetic PCOS patient dataset. Our proposed FL models are a tool to access massive quantities of diverse data and identify the most effective treatment option while providing PCOS patients with privacy guarantees.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Multimodal data, which can comprehensively perceive and recognize the physical world, has become an essential path towards general artificial intelligence. However, multimodal large models trained on public datasets often underperform in specific industrial domains. This paper proposes a multimodal federated learning framework that enables multiple enterprises to utilize private domain data to collaboratively train large models for vertical domains, achieving intelligent services across scenarios. The authors discuss in-depth the strategic transformation of federated learning in terms of intelligence foundation and objectives in the era of big model, as well as the new challenges faced in heterogeneous data, model aggregation, performance and cost trade-off, data privacy, and incentive mechanism. The paper elaborates a case study of leading enterprises contributing multimodal data and expert knowledge to city safety operation management , including distributed deployment and efficient coordination of the federated learning platform, technical innovations on data quality improvement based on large model capabilities and efficient joint fine-tuning approaches. Preliminary experiments show that enterprises can enhance and accumulate intelligent capabilities through multimodal model federated learning, thereby jointly creating an smart city model that provides high-quality intelligent services covering energy infrastructure safety, residential community security, and urban operation management. The established federated learning cooperation ecosystem is expected to further aggregate industry, academia, and research resources, realize large models in multiple vertical domains, and promote the large-scale industrial application of artificial intelligence and cutting-edge research on multimodal federated learning.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>A growing body of work leverages the Hamiltonian formalism as an inductive bias for physically plausible neural network based video generation. The structure of the Hamiltonian ensures conservation of a learned quantity (e.g., energy) and imposes a phase-space interpretation on the low-dimensional manifold underlying the input video. While this interpretation has the potential to facilitate the integration of learned representations in downstream tasks, existing methods are limited in their applicability as they require a structural prior for the configuration space at design time. In this work, we present a GAN-based video generation pipeline with a learned configuration space map and Hamiltonian neural network motion model, to learn a representation of the configuration space from data. We train our model with a physics-inspired cyclic-coordinate loss function which encourages a minimal representation of the configuration space and improves interpretability. We demonstrate the efficacy and advantages of our approach on the Hamiltonian Dynamics Suite Toy Physics dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Spatial-temporal data modeling aims to mine the underlying spatial relationships and temporal dependencies of objects in a system. However, most existing methods focus on the modeling of spatial-temporal data in a single mode, lacking the understanding of multiple modes. Though very few methods have been presented to learn the multi-mode relationships recently, they are built on complicated components with higher model complexities. In this paper, we propose a simple framework for multi-mode spatial-temporal data modeling to bring both effectiveness and efficiency together. Specifically, we design a general cross-mode spatial relationships learning component to adaptively establish connections between multiple modes and propagate information along the learned connections. Moreover, we employ multi-layer perceptrons to capture the temporal dependencies and channel correlations, which are conceptually and technically succinct. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that our model can consistently outperform the baselines with lower space and time complexity, opening up a promising direction for modeling spatial-temporal data. The generalizability of the cross-mode spatial relationships learning module is also validated.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>RNN-based methods have faced challenges in the Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) domain when dealing with excessively long look-back windows and forecast horizons. Consequently, the dominance in this domain has shifted towards Transformer, MLP, and CNN approaches. The substantial number of recurrent iterations are the fundamental reasons behind the limitations of RNNs in LTSF. To address these issues, we propose two novel strategies to reduce the number of iterations in RNNs for LTSF tasks: Segment-wise Iterations and Parallel Multi-step Forecasting (PMF). RNNs that combine these strategies, namely SegRNN, significantly reduce the required recurrent iterations for LTSF, resulting in notable improvements in forecast accuracy and inference speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SegRNN not only outperforms SOTA Transformer-based models but also reduces runtime and memory usage by more than 78%. These achievements provide strong evidence that RNNs continue to excel in LTSF tasks and encourage further exploration of this domain with more RNN-based approaches. The source code is coming soon.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Transformers have demonstrated tremendous success not only in the natural language processing (NLP) domain but also the field of computer vision, igniting various creative approaches and applications. Yet, the superior performance and modeling flexibility of transformers came with a severe increase in computation costs, and hence several works have proposed methods to reduce this burden. Inspired by a cost-cutting method originally proposed for language models, Data Multiplexing (DataMUX), we propose a novel approach for efficient visual recognition that employs additional dim1 batching (i.e., concatenation) that greatly improves the throughput with little compromise in the accuracy. We first introduce a naive adaptation of DataMux for vision models, Image Multiplexer, and devise novel components to overcome its weaknesses, rendering our final model, ConcatPlexer, at the sweet spot between inference speed and accuracy. The ConcatPlexer was trained on ImageNet1K and CIFAR100 dataset and it achieved 23.5% less GFLOPs than ViT-B&#x2F;16 with 69.5% and 83.4% validation accuracy, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This study’s first purpose is to provide quantitative evidence that would incentivize researchers to instead use the more robust method of nested cross-validation. The second purpose is to present methods and MATLAB codes for doing power analysis for ML-based analysis during the design of a study. Monte Carlo simulations were used to quantify the interactions between the employed cross-validation method, the discriminative power of features, the dimensionality of the feature space, and the dimensionality of the model. Four different cross-validations (single holdout, 10-fold, train-validation-test, and nested 10-fold) were compared based on the statistical power and statistical confidence of the ML models. Distributions of the null and alternative hypotheses were used to determine the minimum required sample size for obtaining a statistically significant outcome ({\alpha}&#x3D;0.05, 1-\b{eta}&#x3D;0.8). Statistical confidence of the model was defined as the probability of correct features being selected and hence being included in the final model. Our analysis showed that the model generated based on the single holdout method had very low statistical power and statistical confidence and that it significantly overestimated the accuracy. Conversely, the nested 10-fold cross-validation resulted in the highest statistical confidence and the highest statistical power, while providing an unbiased estimate of the accuracy. The required sample size with a single holdout could be 50% higher than what would be needed if nested cross-validation were used. Confidence in the model based on nested cross-validation was as much as four times higher than the confidence in the single holdout-based model. A computational model, MATLAB codes, and lookup tables are provided to assist researchers with estimating the sample size during the design of their future studies.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Several methods exist today to accelerate Machine Learning(ML) or Deep-Learning(DL) model performance for training and inference. However, modern techniques that rely on various graph and operator parallelism methodologies rely on search space optimizations which are costly in terms of power and hardware usage. Especially in the case of inference, when the batch size is 1 and execution is on CPUs or for power-constrained edge devices, current techniques can become costly, complicated or inapplicable. To ameliorate this, we present a Critical-Path-based Linear Clustering approach to exploit inherent parallel paths in ML dataflow graphs. Our task parallelization approach further optimizes the structure of graphs via cloning and prunes them via constant propagation and dead-code elimination. Contrary to other work, we generate readable and executable parallel Pytorch+Python code from input ML models in ONNX format via a new tool that we have built called {\bf Ramiel}. This allows us to benefit from other downstream acceleration techniques like intra-op parallelism and potentially pipeline parallelism. Our preliminary results on several ML graphs demonstrate up to 1.9$\times$ speedup over serial execution and outperform some of the current mechanisms in both compile and runtimes. Lastly, our methods are lightweight and fast enough so that they can be used effectively for power and resource-constrained devices, while still enabling downstream optimizations.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Error prediction in large language models often relies on domain-specific information. In this paper, we present measures for quantification of error in the response of a large language model based on the diversity of responses to a given prompt - hence independent of the underlying application. We describe how three such measures - based on entropy, Gini impurity, and centroid distance - can be employed. We perform a suite of experiments on multiple datasets and temperature settings to demonstrate that these measures strongly correlate with the probability of failure. Additionally, we present empirical results demonstrating how these measures can be applied to few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and error detection.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Simultaneous segmentation and classification of nuclei in digital histology play an essential role in computer-assisted cancer diagnosis; however, it remains challenging. The highest achieved binary and multi-class Panoptic Quality (PQ) remains as low as 0.68 bPQ and 0.49 mPQ, respectively. It is due to the higher staining variability, variability across the tissue, rough clinical conditions, overlapping nuclei, and nuclear class imbalance. The generic deep-learning methods usually rely on end-to-end models, which fail to address these problems associated explicitly with digital histology. In our previous work, DAN-NucNet, we resolved these issues for semantic segmentation with an end-to-end model. This work extends our previous model to simultaneous instance segmentation and classification. We introduce additional decoder heads with independent weighted losses, which produce semantic segmentation, edge proposals, and classification maps. We use the outputs from the three-head model to apply post-processing to produce the final segmentation and classification. Our multi-stage approach utilizes edge proposals and semantic segmentations compared to direct segmentation and classification strategies followed by most state-of-the-art methods. Due to this, we demonstrate a significant performance improvement in producing high-quality instance segmentation and nuclei classification. We have achieved a 0.841 Dice score for semantic segmentation, 0.713 bPQ scores for instance segmentation, and 0.633 mPQ for nuclei classification. Our proposed framework is generalized across 19 types of tissues. Furthermore, the framework is less complex compared to the state-of-the-art.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. They include a group of malignant neoplasms with a variety of biological, clinical, and histopathological characteristics. There are more than 35 different histological forms of breast lesions that can be classified and diagnosed histologically according to cell morphology, growth, and architecture patterns. Recently, deep learning, in the field of artificial intelligence, has drawn a lot of attention for the computerized representation of medical images. Searchable digital atlases can provide pathologists with patch matching tools allowing them to search among evidently diagnosed and treated archival cases, a technology that may be regarded as computational second opinion. In this study, we indexed and analyzed the WHO breast taxonomy (Classification of Tumours 5th Ed.) spanning 35 tumour types. We visualized all tumour types using deep features extracted from a state-of-the-art deep learning model, pre-trained on millions of diagnostic histopathology images from the TCGA repository. Furthermore, we test the concept of a digital “atlas” as a reference for search and matching with rare test cases. The patch similarity search within the WHO breast taxonomy data reached over 88% accuracy when validating through “majority vote” and more than 91% accuracy when validating using top-n tumour types.

<p>Abstract:<br>Neural force fields (NFFs) have gained prominence in computational chemistry as surrogate models, superseding quantum-chemistry calculations in ab initio molecular dynamics. The prevalent benchmark for NFFs has been the MD17 dataset and its subsequent extension. These datasets predominantly comprise geometries from the equilibrium region of the ground electronic state potential energy surface, sampling from direct adiabatic dynamics. However, many chemical reactions entail significant molecular deformations, notably bond breaking. We demonstrate the constrained distribution of internal coordinates and energies in the MD17 datasets, underscoring their inadequacy for representing systems undergoing chemical reactions. Addressing this sampling limitation, we introduce the xxMD (Extended Excited-state Molecular Dynamics) dataset, derived from non-adiabatic dynamics. This dataset encompasses energies and forces ascertained from both multireference wave function theory and density functional theory. Furthermore, its nuclear configuration spaces authentically depict chemical reactions, making xxMD a more chemically relevant dataset. Our re-assessment of equivariant models on the xxMD datasets reveals notably higher mean absolute errors than those reported for MD17 and its variants. This observation underscores the challenges faced in crafting a generalizable NFF model with extrapolation capability.

<p>Abstract:<br>Swarm robotics is envisioned to automate a large number of dirty, dangerous, and dull tasks. Robots have limited energy, computation capability, and communication resources. Therefore, current swarm robotics have a small number of robots, which can only provide limited spatio-temporal information. In this paper, we propose to leverage the mobile edge computing to alleviate the computation burden. We develop an effective solution based on a mobility-aware deep reinforcement learning model at the edge server side for computing scheduling and resource. Our results show that the proposed approach can meet delay requirements and guarantee computation precision by using minimum robot energy.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The latest satellite communication (SatCom) missions are characterized by a fully reconfigurable on-board software-defined payload, capable of adapting radio resources to the temporal and spatial variations of the system traffic. As pure optimization-based solutions have shown to be computationally tedious and to lack flexibility, machine learning (ML)-based methods have emerged as promising alternatives. We investigate the application of energy-efficient brain-inspired ML models for on-board radio resource management. Apart from software simulation, we report extensive experimental results leveraging the recently released Intel Loihi 2 chip. To benchmark the performance of the proposed model, we implement conventional convolutional neural networks (CNN) on a Xilinx Versal VCK5000, and provide a detailed comparison of accuracy, precision, recall, and energy efficiency for different traffic demands. Most notably, for relevant workloads, spiking neural networks (SNNs) implemented on Loihi 2 yield higher accuracy, while reducing power consumption by more than 100$\times$ as compared to the CNN-based reference platform. Our findings point to the significant potential of neuromorphic computing and SNNs in supporting on-board SatCom operations, paving the way for enhanced efficiency and sustainability in future SatCom systems.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The automation of code review activities, a long-standing pursuit in software engineering, has been primarily addressed by numerous domain-specific pre-trained models. Despite their success, these models frequently demand extensive resources for pre-training from scratch. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) provide an intriguing alternative, given their remarkable capabilities when supplemented with domain-specific knowledge. However, their potential for automating code review tasks remains largely unexplored.   In response to this research gap, we present LLaMA-Reviewer, an innovative framework that leverages the capabilities of LLaMA, a popular LLM, in the realm of code review. Mindful of resource constraints, this framework employs parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, delivering high performance while using less than 1% of trainable parameters.   An extensive evaluation of LLaMA-Reviewer is conducted on two diverse, publicly available datasets. Notably, even with the smallest LLaMA base model consisting of 6.7B parameters and a limited number of tuning epochs, LLaMA-Reviewer equals the performance of existing code-review-focused models.   The ablation experiments provide insights into the influence of various fine-tuning process components, including input representation, instruction tuning, and different PEFT methods. To foster continuous progress in this field, the code and all PEFT-weight plugins have been made open-source.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The success of supervised deep learning models on cell recognition tasks relies on detailed annotations. Many previous works have managed to reduce the dependency on labels. However, considering the large number of cells contained in a patch, costly and inefficient labeling is still inevitable. To this end, we explored label-free methods for cell recognition. Prior self-activation maps (PSM) are proposed to generate pseudo masks as training targets. To be specific, an activation network is trained with self-supervised learning. The gradient information in the shallow layers of the network is aggregated to generate prior self-activation maps. Afterward, a semantic clustering module is then introduced as a pipeline to transform PSMs to pixel-level semantic pseudo masks for downstream tasks. We evaluated our method on two histological datasets: MoNuSeg (cell segmentation) and BCData (multi-class cell detection). Compared with other fully-supervised and weakly-supervised methods, our method can achieve competitive performance without any manual annotations. Our simple but effective framework can also achieve multi-class cell detection which can not be done by existing unsupervised methods. The results show the potential of PSMs that might inspire other research to deal with the hunger for labels in medical area.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This research aims to improve the accuracy of complex volleyball predictions and provide more meaningful insights to coaches and players. We introduce a specialized graph encoding technique to add additional contact-by-contact volleyball context to an already available volleyball dataset without any additional data gathering. We demonstrate the potential benefits of using graph neural networks (GNNs) on this enriched dataset for three different volleyball prediction tasks: rally outcome prediction, set location prediction, and hit type prediction. We compare the performance of our graph-based models to baseline models and analyze the results to better understand the underlying relationships in a volleyball rally. Our results show that the use of GNNs with our graph encoding yields a much more advanced analysis of the data, which noticeably improves prediction results overall. We also show that these baseline tasks can be significantly improved with simple adjustments, such as removing blocked hits. Lastly, we demonstrate the importance of choosing a model architecture that will better extract the important information for a certain task. Overall, our study showcases the potential strengths and weaknesses of using graph encodings in sports data analytics and hopefully will inspire future improvements in machine learning strategies across sports and applications by using graphbased encodings.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Interactive Recommender Systems (IRSs) have attracted a lot of attention, due to their ability to model interactive processes between users and recommender systems. Numerous approaches have adopted Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, as these can directly maximize users’ cumulative rewards. In IRS, researchers commonly utilize publicly available review datasets to compare and evaluate algorithms. However, user feedback provided in public datasets merely includes instant responses (e.g., a rating), with no inclusion of delayed responses (e.g., the dwell time and the lifetime value). Thus, the question remains whether these review datasets are an appropriate choice to evaluate the long-term effects of the IRS. In this work, we revisited experiments on IRS with review datasets and compared RL-based models with a simple reward model that greedily recommends the item with the highest one-step reward. Following extensive analysis, we can reveal three main findings: First, a simple greedy reward model consistently outperforms RL-based models in maximizing cumulative rewards. Second, applying higher weighting to long-term rewards leads to a degradation of recommendation performance. Third, user feedbacks have mere long-term effects on the benchmark datasets. Based on our findings, we conclude that a dataset has to be carefully verified and that a simple greedy baseline should be included for a proper evaluation of RL-based IRS approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Graph transformers need strong inductive biases to derive meaningful attention scores. Yet, current proposals rarely address methods capturing longer ranges, hierarchical structures, or community structures, as they appear in various graphs such as molecules, social networks, and citation networks. In this paper, we propose a hierarchy-distance structural encoding (HDSE), which models a hierarchical distance between the nodes in a graph focusing on its multi-level, hierarchical nature. In particular, this yields a framework which can be flexibly integrated with existing graph transformers, allowing for simultaneous application with other positional representations. Through extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our HDSE method successfully enhances various types of baseline transformers, achieving state-of-the-art empirical performances on 10 benchmark datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superior performance on various graph learning tasks, including recommendation, where they leverage user-item collaborative filtering signals in graphs. However, theoretical formulations of their capability are scarce, despite their empirical effectiveness in state-of-the-art recommender models. Recently, research has explored the expressiveness of GNNs in general, demonstrating that message passing GNNs are at most as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman test, and that GNNs combined with random node initialization are universal. Nevertheless, the concept of “expressiveness” for GNNs remains vaguely defined. Most existing works adopt the graph isomorphism test as the metric of expressiveness, but this graph-level task may not effectively assess a model’s ability in recommendation, where the objective is to distinguish nodes of different closeness. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the expressiveness of GNNs in recommendation, considering three levels of expressiveness metrics: graph isomorphism (graph-level), node automorphism (node-level), and topological closeness (link-level). We propose the topological closeness metric to evaluate GNNs’ ability to capture the structural distance between nodes, which aligns closely with the objective of recommendation. To validate the effectiveness of this new metric in evaluating recommendation performance, we introduce a learning-less GNN algorithm that is optimal on the new metric and can be optimal on the node-level metric with suitable modification. We conduct extensive experiments comparing the proposed algorithm against various types of state-of-the-art GNN models to explore the explainability of the new metric in the recommendation task.

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper presents a novel method that leverages a visual-language model, CLIP, as a data source for zero-shot anomaly detection. Tremendous efforts have been put towards developing anomaly detectors due to their potential industrial applications. Considering the difficulty in acquiring various anomalous samples for training, most existing methods train models with only normal samples and measure discrepancies from the distribution of normal samples during inference, which requires training a model for each object category. The problem of this inefficient training requirement has been tackled by designing a CLIP-based anomaly detector that applies prompt-guided classification to each part of an image in a sliding window manner. However, the method still suffers from the labor of careful prompt ensembling with known object categories. To overcome the issues above, we propose leveraging CLIP as a data source for training. Our method generates text embeddings with the text encoder in CLIP with typical prompts that include words of normal and anomaly. In addition to these words, we insert several randomly generated words into prompts, which enables the encoder to generate a diverse set of normal and anomalous samples. Using the generated embeddings as training data, a feed-forward neural network learns to extract features of normal and anomaly from CLIP’s embeddings, and as a result, a category-agnostic anomaly detector can be obtained without any training images. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without laborious prompt ensembling in zero-shot setups.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper proposes a novel quantum pre-processing filter (QPF) to improve the image classification accuracy of neural network (NN) models. A simple four qubit quantum circuit that uses Y rotation gates for encoding and two controlled NOT gates for creating correlation among the qubits is applied as a feature extraction filter prior to passing data into the fully connected NN architecture. By applying the QPF approach, the results show that the image classification accuracy based on the MNIST (handwritten 10 digits) and the EMNIST (handwritten 47 class digits and letters) datasets can be improved, from 92.5% to 95.4% and from 68.9% to 75.9%, respectively. These improvements were obtained without introducing extra model parameters or optimizations in the machine learning process. However, tests performed on the developed QPF approach against a relatively complex GTSRB dataset with 43 distinct class real-life traffic sign images showed a degradation in the classification accuracy. Considering this result, further research into the understanding and the design of a more suitable quantum circuit approach for image classification neural networks could be explored utilizing the baseline method proposed in this paper.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The Automated Model Evaluation (AutoEval) framework entertains the possibility of evaluating a trained machine learning model without resorting to a labeled testing set. Despite the promise and some decent results, the existing AutoEval methods heavily rely on computing distribution shifts between the unlabelled testing set and the training set. We believe this reliance on the training set becomes another obstacle in shipping this technology to real-world ML development. In this work, we propose Contrastive Automatic Model Evaluation (CAME), a novel AutoEval framework that is rid of involving training set in the loop. The core idea of CAME bases on a theoretical analysis which bonds the model performance with a contrastive loss. Further, with extensive empirical validation, we manage to set up a predictable relationship between the two, simply by deducing on the unlabeled&#x2F;unseen testing set. The resulting framework CAME establishes a new SOTA results for AutoEval by surpassing prior work significantly.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Anonymity of both natural and legal persons in court rulings is a critical aspect of privacy protection in the European Union and Switzerland. With the advent of LLMs, concerns about large-scale re-identification of anonymized persons are growing. In accordance with the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland, we explore the potential of LLMs to re-identify individuals in court rulings by constructing a proof-of-concept using actual legal data from the Swiss federal supreme court. Following the initial experiment, we constructed an anonymized Wikipedia dataset as a more rigorous testing ground to further investigate the findings. With the introduction and application of the new task of re-identifying people in texts, we also introduce new metrics to measure performance. We systematically analyze the factors that influence successful re-identifications, identifying model size, input length, and instruction tuning among the most critical determinants. Despite high re-identification rates on Wikipedia, even the best LLMs struggled with court decisions. The complexity is attributed to the lack of test datasets, the necessity for substantial training resources, and data sparsity in the information used for re-identification. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that re-identification using LLMs may not be feasible for now, but as the proof-of-concept on Wikipedia showed, it might become possible in the future. We hope that our system can help enhance the confidence in the security of anonymized decisions, thus leading to the courts being more confident to publish decisions.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Interpretability of artificial intelligence (AI) methods, particularly deep neural networks, is of great interest due to the widespread use of AI-backed systems, which often have unexplainable behavior. The interpretability of such models is a crucial component of building trusted systems. Many methods exist to approach this problem, but they do not obviously generalize to the quantum setting. Here we explore the interpretability of quantum neural networks using local model-agnostic interpretability measures of quantum and classical neural networks. We introduce the concept of the band of inexplicability, representing the interpretable region in which data samples have no explanation, likely victims of inherently random quantum measurements. We see this as a step toward understanding how to build responsible and accountable quantum AI models.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We present an architecture and a training recipe that adapts pre-trained open-world image models to localization in videos. Understanding the open visual world (without being constrained by fixed label spaces) is crucial for many real-world vision tasks. Contrastive pre-training on large image-text datasets has recently led to significant improvements for image-level tasks. For more structured tasks involving object localization applying pre-trained models is more challenging. This is particularly true for video tasks, where task-specific data is limited. We show successful transfer of open-world models by building on the OWL-ViT open-vocabulary detection model and adapting it to video by adding a transformer decoder. The decoder propagates object representations recurrently through time by using the output tokens for one frame as the object queries for the next. Our model is end-to-end trainable on video data and enjoys improved temporal consistency compared to tracking-by-detection baselines, while retaining the open-world capabilities of the backbone detector. We evaluate our model on the challenging TAO-OW benchmark and demonstrate that open-world capabilities, learned from large-scale image-text pre-training, can be transferred successfully to open-world localization across diverse videos.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Algorithmic Fairness and the explainability of potentially unfair outcomes are crucial for establishing trust and accountability of Artificial Intelligence systems in domains such as healthcare and policing. Though significant advances have been made in each of the fields separately, achieving explainability in fairness applications remains challenging, particularly so in domains where deep neural networks are used. At the same time, ethical data-mining has become ever more relevant, as it has been shown countless times that fairness-unaware algorithms result in biased outcomes. Current approaches focus on mitigating biases in the outcomes of the model, but few attempts have been made to try to explain \emph{why} a model is biased. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive approach that leverages optimal transport theory to uncover the causes and implications of biased regions in images, which easily extends to tabular data as well. Through the use of Wasserstein barycenters, we obtain scores that are independent of a sensitive variable but keep their marginal orderings. This step ensures predictive accuracy but also helps us to recover the regions most associated with the generation of the biases.

<p>Abstract:<br>Data-driven constitutive modeling frameworks based on neural networks and classical representation theorems have recently gained considerable attention due to their ability to easily incorporate constitutive constraints and their excellent generalization performance. In these models, the stress prediction follows from a linear combination of invariant-dependent coefficient functions and known tensor basis generators. However, thus far the formulations have been limited to stress representations based on the classical Rivlin and Ericksen form, while the performance of alternative representations has yet to be investigated. In this work, we survey a variety of tensor basis neural network models for modeling hyperelastic materials in a finite deformation context, including a number of so far unexplored formulations which use theoretically equivalent invariants and generators to Finger-Rivlin-Ericksen. Furthermore, we compare potential-based and coefficient-based approaches, as well as different calibration techniques. Nine variants are tested against both noisy and noiseless datasets for three different materials. Theoretical and practical insights into the performance of each formulation are given.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Predicting high dimensional video sequences is a curiously difficult problem. The number of possible futures for a given video sequence grows exponentially over time due to uncertainty. This is especially evident when trying to predict complicated natural video scenes from a limited snapshot of the world. The inherent uncertainty accumulates the further into the future you predict making long-term prediction very difficult. In this work we introduce a number of improvements to existing work that aid in creating Robust Video Predictors (RoViPs). We show that with a combination of deep Perceptual and uncertainty-based reconstruction losses we are able to create high quality short-term predictions. Attention-based skip connections are utilised to allow for long range spatial movement of input features to further improve performance. Finally, we show that by simply making the predictor robust to its own prediction errors, it is possible to produce very long, realistic natural video sequences using an iterated single-step prediction task.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The renormalization group (RG) is an essential technique in statistical physics and quantum field theory, which considers scale-invariant properties of physical theories and how these theories’ parameters change with scaling. Deep learning is a powerful computational technique that uses multi-layered neural networks to solve a myriad of complicated problems. Previous research suggests the possibility that unsupervised deep learning may be a form of RG flow, by being a layer-by-layer coarse graining of the original data. We examined this connection on a more rigorous basis for the simple example of Kadanoff block renormalization of the 2D nearest-neighbor Ising model, with our deep learning accomplished via Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). We developed extensive renormalization techniques for the 1D and 2D Ising model to provide a baseline for comparison. For the 1D Ising model, we successfully used Adam optimization on a correlation length loss function to learn the group flow, yielding results consistent with the analytical model for infinite N. For the 2D Ising model, we successfully generated Ising model samples using the Wolff algorithm, and performed the group flow using a quasi-deterministic method, validating these results by calculating the critical exponent \nu. We then examined RBM learning of the Ising model layer by layer, finding a blocking structure in the learning that is qualitatively similar to RG. Lastly, we directly compared the weights of each layer from the learning to Ising spin renormalization, but found quantitative inconsistencies for the simple case of nearest-neighbor Ising models.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Multi-agent interactions, such as communication, teaching, and bluffing, often rely on higher-order social inference, i.e., understanding how others infer oneself. Such intricate reasoning can be effectively modeled through nested multi-agent reasoning. Nonetheless, the computational complexity escalates exponentially with each level of reasoning, posing a significant challenge. However, humans effortlessly perform complex social inferences as part of their daily lives. To bridge the gap between human-like inference capabilities and computational limitations, we propose a novel approach: leveraging neural networks to amortize high-order social inference, thereby expediting nested multi-agent reasoning. We evaluate our method in two challenging multi-agent interaction domains. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is computationally efficient while exhibiting minimal degradation in accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recently emerged Topological Deep Learning (TDL) methods aim to extend current Graph Neural Networks (GNN) by naturally processing higher-order interactions, going beyond the pairwise relations and local neighborhoods defined by graph representations. In this paper we propose a novel TDL-based method for compressing signals over graphs, consisting in two main steps: first, disjoint sets of higher-order structures are inferred based on the original signal –by clustering $N$ datapoints into $K\ll N$ collections; then, a topological-inspired message passing gets a compressed representation of the signal within those multi-element sets. Our results show that our framework improves both standard GNN and feed-forward architectures in compressing temporal link-based signals from two real-word Internet Service Provider Networks’ datasets –from $30%$ up to $90%$ better reconstruction errors across all evaluation scenarios–, suggesting that it better captures and exploits spatial and temporal correlations over the whole graph-based network structure.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>While large-scale image-text pretrained models such as CLIP have been used for multiple video-level tasks on trimmed videos, their use for temporal localization in untrimmed videos is still a relatively unexplored task. We design a new approach for this called UnLoc, which uses pretrained image and text towers, and feeds tokens to a video-text fusion model. The output of the fusion module are then used to construct a feature pyramid in which each level connects to a head to predict a per-frame relevancy score and start&#x2F;end time displacements. Unlike previous works, our architecture enables Moment Retrieval, Temporal Localization, and Action Segmentation with a single stage model, without the need for action proposals, motion based pretrained features or representation masking. Unlike specialized models, we achieve state of the art results on all three different localization tasks with a unified approach.

<p>Abstract:<br>Recently, foundation models have exhibited remarkable advancements in multi-modal learning. These models, equipped with millions (or billions) of parameters, typically require a substantial amount of data for finetuning. However, collecting and centralizing training data from diverse sectors becomes challenging due to distinct privacy regulations. Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a promising solution, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively train neural networks without centralizing their local data. To alleviate client computation burdens and communication overheads, previous works have adapted Parameter-efficient Finetuning (PEFT) methods for FL. Hereby, only a small fraction of the model parameters are optimized and communicated during federated communications. Nevertheless, most previous works have focused on a single modality and neglected one common phenomenon, i.e., the presence of data heterogeneity across the clients. Therefore, in this work, we propose a finetuning framework tailored to heterogeneous multi-modal FL, called Federated Dual-Aadapter Teacher (FedDAT). Specifically, our approach leverages a Dual-Adapter Teacher (DAT) to address data heterogeneity by regularizing the client local updates and applying Mutual Knowledge Distillation (MKD) for an efficient knowledge transfer. FedDAT is the first approach that enables an efficient distributed finetuning of foundation models for a variety of heterogeneous Vision-Language tasks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on four multi-modality FL benchmarks with different types of data heterogeneity, where FedDAT substantially outperforms the existing centralized PEFT methods adapted for FL.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Echo cancellation and noise reduction are essential for full-duplex communication, yet most existing neural networks have high computational costs and are inflexible in tuning model complexity. In this paper, we introduce time-frequency dual-path compression to achieve a wide range of compression ratios on computational cost. Specifically, for frequency compression, trainable filters are used to replace manually designed filters for dimension reduction. For time compression, only using frame skipped prediction causes large performance degradation, which can be alleviated by a post-processing network with full sequence modeling. We have found that under fixed compression ratios, dual-path compression combining both the time and frequency methods will give further performance improvement, covering compression ratios from 4x to 32x with little model size change. Moreover, the proposed models show competitive performance compared with fast FullSubNet and DeepFilterNet.

<p>Abstract:<br>For machine learning-based prognosis and diagnosis of rare diseases, such as pediatric brain tumors, it is necessary to gather medical imaging data from multiple clinical sites that may use different devices and protocols. Deep learning-driven harmonization of radiologic images relies on generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs notoriously generate pseudo structures that do not exist in the original training data, a phenomenon known as “hallucination”. To prevent hallucination in medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain, we propose a one-shot learning method where we utilize neural style transfer for harmonization. At test time, the method uses one image from a clinical site to generate an image that matches the intensity scale of the collaborating sites. Our approach combines learning a feature extractor, neural style transfer, and adaptive instance normalization. We further propose a novel strategy to evaluate the effectiveness of image harmonization approaches with evaluation metrics that both measure image style harmonization and assess the preservation of anatomical structures. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in preserving patient anatomy while adjusting the image intensities to a new clinical site. Our general harmonization model can be used on unseen data from new sites, making it a valuable tool for real-world medical applications and clinical trials.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Spurious correlations occur when a model learns unreliable features from the data and are a well-known drawback of data-driven learning. Although there are several algorithms proposed to mitigate it, we are yet to jointly derive the indicators of spurious correlations. As a result, the solutions built upon standalone hypotheses fail to beat simple ERM baselines. We collect some of the commonly studied hypotheses behind the occurrence of spurious correlations and investigate their influence on standard ERM baselines using synthetic datasets generated from causal graphs. Subsequently, we observe patterns connecting these hypotheses and model design choices.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Deep learning continues to rapidly evolve and is now demonstrating remarkable potential for numerous medical prediction tasks. However, realizing deep learning models that generalize across healthcare organizations is challenging. This is due, in part, to the inherent siloed nature of these organizations and patient privacy requirements. To address this problem, we illustrate how split learning can enable collaborative training of deep learning models across disparate and privately maintained health datasets, while keeping the original records and model parameters private. We introduce a new privacy-preserving distributed learning framework that offers a higher level of privacy compared to conventional federated learning. We use several biomedical imaging and electronic health record (EHR) datasets to show that deep learning models trained via split learning can achieve highly similar performance to their centralized and federated counterparts while greatly improving computational efficiency and reducing privacy risks.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recommendation Systems (RS) are often used to address the issue of medical doctor referrals. However, these systems require access to patient feedback and medical records, which may not always be available in real-world scenarios. Our research focuses on medical referrals and aims to predict recommendations in different specialties of physicians for both new patients and those with a consultation history. We use Extreme Multilabel Classification (XML), commonly employed in text-based classification tasks, to encode available features and explore different scenarios. While its potential for recommendation tasks has often been suggested, this has not been thoroughly explored in the literature. Motivated by the doctor referral case, we show how to recast a traditional recommender setting into a multilabel classification problem that current XML methods can solve. Further, we propose a unified model leveraging patient history across different specialties. Compared to state-of-the-art RS using the same features, our approach consistently improves standard recommendation metrics up to approximately $10%$ for patients with a previous consultation history. For new patients, XML proves better at exploiting available features, outperforming the benchmark in favorable scenarios, with particular emphasis on recall metrics. Thus, our approach brings us one step closer to creating more effective and personalized doctor referral systems. Additionally, it highlights XML as a promising alternative to current hybrid or content-based RS, while identifying key aspects to take into account when using XML for recommendation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>There are many ways of interpreting the world and they are highly interdependent. We exploit such complex dependencies and introduce a powerful multi-task hypergraph, in which every node is a task and different paths through the hypergraph reaching a given task become unsupervised teachers, by forming ensembles that learn to generate reliable pseudolabels for that task. Each hyperedge is part of an ensemble teacher for a given task and it is also a student of the self-supervised hypergraph system. We apply our model to one of the most important problems of our times, that of Earth Observation, which is highly multi-task and it often suffers from missing ground-truth data. By performing extensive experiments on the NASA NEO Dataset, spanning a period of 22 years, we demonstrate the value of our multi-task semi-supervised approach, by consistent improvements over strong baselines and recent work. We also show that the hypergraph can adapt unsupervised to gradual data distribution shifts and reliably recover, through its multi-task self-supervision process, the missing data for several observational layers for up to seven years.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This work presents the design, implementation and validation of learning techniques based on the kNN scheme for gesture detection in prosthetic control. To cope with high computational demands in instance-based prediction, methods of dataset reduction are evaluated considering real-time determinism to allow for the reliable integration into battery-powered portable devices. The influence of parameterization and varying proportionality schemes is analyzed, utilizing an eight-channel-sEMG armband. Besides offline cross-validation accuracy, success rates in real-time pilot experiments (online target achievement tests) are determined. Based on the assessment of specific dataset reduction techniques’ adequacy for embedded control applications regarding accuracy and timing behaviour, Decision Surface Mapping (DSM) proves itself promising when applying kNN on the reduced set. A randomized, double-blind user study was conducted to evaluate the respective methods (kNN and kNN with DSM-reduction) against Ridge Regression (RR) and RR with Random Fourier Features (RR-RFF). The kNN-based methods performed significantly better (p&lt;0.0005) than the regression techniques. Between DSM-kNN and kNN, there was no statistically significant difference (significance level 0.05). This is remarkable in consideration of only one sample per class in the reduced set, thus yielding a reduction rate of over 99% while preserving success rate. The same behaviour could be confirmed in an extended user study. With k&#x3D;1, which turned out to be an excellent choice, the runtime complexity of both kNN (in every prediction step) as well as DSM-kNN (in the training phase) becomes linear concerning the number of original samples, favouring dependable wearable prosthesis applications.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Clinical event sequences consist of hundreds of clinical events that represent records of patient care in time. Developing accurate predictive models of such sequences is of a great importance for supporting a variety of models for interpreting&#x2F;classifying the current patient condition, or predicting adverse clinical events and outcomes, all aimed to improve patient care. One important challenge of learning predictive models of clinical sequences is their patient-specific variability. Based on underlying clinical conditions, each patient’s sequence may consist of different sets of clinical events (observations, lab results, medications, procedures). Hence, simple population-wide models learned from event sequences for many different patients may not accurately predict patient-specific dynamics of event sequences and their differences. To address the problem, we propose and investigate multiple new event sequence prediction models and methods that let us better adjust the prediction for individual patients and their specific conditions. The methods developed in this work pursue refinement of population-wide models to subpopulations, self-adaptation, and a meta-level model switching that is able to adaptively select the model with the best chance to support the immediate prediction. We analyze and test the performance of these models on clinical event sequences of patients in MIMIC-III database.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We propose a new way to assess certain short constructed responses to mathematics items. Our approach uses a pipeline that identifies the key values specified by the student in their response. This allows us to determine the correctness of the response, as well as identify any misconceptions. The information from the value identification pipeline can then be used to provide feedback to the teacher and student. The value identification pipeline consists of two fine-tuned language models. The first model determines if a value is implicit in the student response. The second model identifies where in the response the key value is specified. We consider both a generic model that can be used for any prompt and value, as well as models that are specific to each prompt and value. The value identification pipeline is a more accurate and informative way to assess short constructed responses than traditional rubric-based scoring. It can be used to provide more targeted feedback to students, which can help them improve their understanding of mathematics.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases, and its short atmospheric half-life makes it a prime target to rapidly curb global warming. However, current methane emission monitoring techniques primarily rely on approximate emission factors or self-reporting, which have been shown to often dramatically underestimate emissions. Although initially designed to monitor surface properties, satellite multispectral data has recently emerged as a powerful method to analyze atmospheric content. However, the spectral resolution of multispectral instruments is poor, and methane measurements are typically very noisy. Methane data products are also sensitive to absorption by the surface and other atmospheric gases (water vapor in particular) and therefore provide noisy maps of potential methane plumes, that typically require extensive human analysis. Here, we show that the image recognition capabilities of deep learning methods can be leveraged to automatize the detection of methane leaks in Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral data, with dramatically reduced false positive rates compared with state-of-the-art multispectral methane data products, and without the need for a priori knowledge of potential leak sites. Our proposed approach paves the way for the automated, high-definition and high-frequency monitoring of point-source methane emissions across the world.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection has developed substantially in the past few years, with available methods approaching, and in a few cases achieving, perfect data separation on standard benchmarks. These results generally involve large or complex models, pretraining, exposure to OoD examples or extra hyperparameter tuning. Remarkably, it is possible to achieve results that can exceed many of these state-of-the-art methods with a very simple method. We demonstrate that ResNet18 trained with Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL) produces state-of-the-art results out-of-the-box on near and far OoD detection benchmarks using only Euclidean distance as a scoring rule. This may obviate the need in some cases for more sophisticated methods or larger models, and at the very least provides a very strong, easy to use baseline for further experimentation and analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We characterize learnability for quantum measurement classes by establishing matching necessary and sufficient conditions for their PAC learnability, along with corresponding sample complexity bounds, in the setting where the learner is given access only to prepared quantum states. We first probe the results from previous works on this setting. We show that the empirical risk defined in previous works and matching the definition in the classical theory fails to satisfy the uniform convergence property enjoyed in the classical setting for some learnable classes. Moreover, we show that VC dimension generalization upper bounds in previous work are frequently infinite, even for finite-dimensional POVM classes. To surmount the failure of the standard ERM to satisfy uniform convergence, we define a new learning rule – denoised ERM. We show this to be a universal learning rule for POVM and probabilistically observed concept classes, and the condition for it to satisfy uniform convergence is finite fat shattering dimension of the class. We give quantitative sample complexity upper and lower bounds for learnability in terms of finite fat-shattering dimension and a notion of approximate finite partitionability into approximately jointly measurable subsets, which allow for sample reuse. We then show that finite fat shattering dimension implies finite coverability by approximately jointly measurable subsets, leading to our matching conditions. We also show that every measurement class defined on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space is PAC learnable. We illustrate our results on several example POVM classes.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recent works have demonstrated success in MRI reconstruction using deep learning-based models. However, most reported approaches require training on a task-specific, large-scale dataset. Regularization by denoising (RED) is a general pipeline which embeds a denoiser as a prior for image reconstruction. The potential of RED has been demonstrated for multiple image-related tasks such as denoising, deblurring and super-resolution. In this work, we propose a regularization by neural style transfer (RNST) method to further leverage the priors from the neural transfer and denoising engine. This enables RNST to reconstruct a high-quality image from a noisy low-quality image with different image styles and limited data. We validate RNST with clinical MRI scans from 1.5T and 3T and show that RNST can significantly boost image quality. Our results highlight the capability of the RNST framework for MRI reconstruction and the potential for reconstruction tasks with limited data.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We tackle the problem of learning complex, general behaviors directly in the real world. We propose an approach for robots to efficiently learn manipulation skills using only a handful of real-world interaction trajectories from many different settings. Inspired by the success of learning from large-scale datasets in the fields of computer vision and natural language, our belief is that in order to efficiently learn, a robot must be able to leverage internet-scale, human video data. Humans interact with the world in many interesting ways, which can allow a robot to not only build an understanding of useful actions and affordances but also how these actions affect the world for manipulation. Our approach builds a structured, human-centric action space grounded in visual affordances learned from human videos. Further, we train a world model on human videos and fine-tune on a small amount of robot interaction data without any task supervision. We show that this approach of affordance-space world models enables different robots to learn various manipulation skills in complex settings, in under 30 minutes of interaction.

<p>Abstract:<br>Privacy-preserving machine learning aims to train models on private data without leaking sensitive information. Differential privacy (DP) is considered the gold standard framework for privacy-preserving training, as it provides formal privacy guarantees. However, compared to their non-private counterparts, models trained with DP often have significantly reduced accuracy. Private classifiers are also believed to exhibit larger performance disparities across subpopulations, raising fairness concerns. The poor performance of classifiers trained with DP has prevented the widespread adoption of privacy preserving machine learning in industry. Here we show that pre-trained foundation models fine-tuned with DP can achieve similar accuracy to non-private classifiers, even in the presence of significant distribution shifts between pre-training data and downstream tasks. We achieve private accuracies within a few percent of the non-private state of the art across four datasets, including two medical imaging benchmarks. Furthermore, our private medical classifiers do not exhibit larger performance disparities across demographic groups than non-private models. This milestone to make DP training a practical and reliable technology has the potential to widely enable machine learning practitioners to train safely on sensitive datasets while protecting individuals’ privacy.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Transformer language models exhibit intelligent behaviors such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, acquiring knowledge, reasoning, planning, reflecting and using tools. This paper explores how their underlying mechanics give rise to intelligent behaviors. We adopt a systems approach to analyze Transformers in detail and develop a mathematical framework that frames their dynamics as movement through embedding space. This novel perspective provides a principled way of thinking about the problem and reveals important insights related to the emergence of intelligence:   1. At its core the Transformer is a Embedding Space walker, mapping intelligent behavior to trajectories in this vector space.   2. At each step of the walk, it composes context into a single composite vector whose location in Embedding Space defines the next step.   3. No learning actually occurs during decoding; in-context learning and generalization are simply the result of different contexts composing into different vectors.   4. Ultimately the knowledge, intelligence and skills exhibited by the model are embodied in the organization of vectors in Embedding Space rather than in specific neurons or layers. These abilities are properties of this organization.   5. Attention’s contribution boils down to the association-bias it lends to vector composition and which influences the aforementioned organization. However, more investigation is needed to ascertain its significance.   6. The entire model is composed from two principal operations: data independent filtering and data dependent aggregation. This generalization unifies Transformers with other sequence models and across modalities.   Building upon this foundation we formalize and test a semantic space theory which posits that embedding vectors represent semantic concepts and find some evidence of its validity.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>A limited set of tools exist for assessing whether the behavior of quantum machine learning models diverges from conventional models, outside of abstract or theoretical settings. We present a systematic application of explainable artificial intelligence techniques to analyze synthetic data generated from a hybrid quantum-classical neural network adapted from twenty different real-world data sets, including solar flares, cardiac arrhythmia, and speech data. Each of these data sets exhibits varying degrees of complexity and class imbalance. We benchmark the quantum-generated data relative to state-of-the-art methods for mitigating class imbalance for associated classification tasks. We leverage this approach to elucidate the qualities of a problem that make it more or less likely to be amenable to a hybrid quantum-classical generative model.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The scarcity of task-labeled time-series benchmarks in the financial domain hinders progress in continual learning. Addressing this deficit would foster innovation in this area. Therefore, we present COB, Crude Oil Benchmark datasets. COB includes 30 years of asset prices that exhibit significant distribution shifts and optimally generates corresponding task (i.e., regime) labels based on these distribution shifts for the three most important crude oils in the world. Our contributions include creating real-world benchmark datasets by transforming asset price data into volatility proxies, fitting models using expectation-maximization (EM), generating contextual task labels that align with real-world events, and providing these labels as well as the general algorithm to the public. We show that the inclusion of these task labels universally improves performance on four continual learning algorithms, some state-of-the-art, over multiple forecasting horizons. We hope these benchmarks accelerate research in handling distribution shifts in real-world data, especially due to the global importance of the assets considered. We’ve made the (1) raw price data, (2) task labels generated by our approach, (3) and code for our algorithm available at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://oilpricebenchmarks.github.io/">https://oilpricebenchmarks.github.io</a>.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Despite the promising results of machine learning models in malware detection, they face the problem of concept drift due to malware constant evolution. This leads to a decline in performance over time, as the data distribution of the new files differs from the training one, requiring regular model update. In this work, we propose a model-agnostic protocol to improve a baseline neural network to handle with the drift problem. We show the importance of feature reduction and training with the most recent validation set possible, and propose a loss function named Drift-Resilient Binary Cross-Entropy, an improvement to the classical Binary Cross-Entropy more effective against drift. We train our model on the EMBER dataset (2018) and evaluate it on a dataset of recent malicious files, collected between 2020 and 2023. Our improved model shows promising results, detecting 15.2% more malware than a baseline model.</p>
