<p>Abstract:<br>To improve the robustness of transformer neural networks used for temporal-dynamics prediction of chaotic systems, we propose a novel attention mechanism called easy attention. Due to the fact that self attention only makes usage of the inner product of queries and keys, it is demonstrated that the keys, queries and softmax are not necessary for obtaining the attention score required to capture long-term dependencies in temporal sequences. Through implementing singular-value decomposition (SVD) on the softmax attention score, we further observe that the self attention compresses contribution from both queries and keys in the spanned space of the attention score. Therefore, our proposed easy-attention method directly treats the attention scores as learnable parameters. This approach produces excellent results when reconstructing and predicting the temporal dynamics of chaotic systems exhibiting more robustness and less complexity than the self attention or the widely-used long short-term memory (LSTM) network. Our results show great potential for applications in more complex high-dimensional dynamical systems.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Efficiently optimizing multi-model inference pipelines for fast, accurate, and cost-effective inference is a crucial challenge in ML production systems, given their tight end-to-end latency requirements. To simplify the exploration of the vast and intricate trade-off space of accuracy and cost in inference pipelines, providers frequently opt to consider one of them. However, the challenge lies in reconciling accuracy and cost trade-offs. To address this challenge and propose a solution to efficiently manage model variants in inference pipelines, we present IPA, an online deep-learning Inference Pipeline Adaptation system that efficiently leverages model variants for each deep learning task. Model variants are different versions of pre-trained models for the same deep learning task with variations in resource requirements, latency, and accuracy. IPA dynamically configures batch size, replication, and model variants to optimize accuracy, minimize costs, and meet user-defined latency SLAs using Integer Programming. It supports multi-objective settings for achieving different trade-offs between accuracy and cost objectives while remaining adaptable to varying workloads and dynamic traffic patterns. Extensive experiments on a Kubernetes implementation with five real-world inference pipelines demonstrate that IPA improves normalized accuracy by up to 35% with a minimal cost increase of less than 5%.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In this article, we present a novel data assimilation strategy in pore-scale imaging and demonstrate that this makes it possible to robustly address reactive inverse problems incorporating Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). Pore-scale modeling of reactive flow offers a valuable opportunity to investigate the evolution of macro-scale properties subject to dynamic processes. Yet, they suffer from imaging limitations arising from the associated X-ray microtomography (X-ray microCT) process, which induces discrepancies in the properties estimates. Assessment of the kinetic parameters also raises challenges, as reactive coefficients are critical parameters that can cover a wide range of values. We account for these two issues and ensure reliable calibration of pore-scale modeling, based on dynamical microCT images, by integrating uncertainty quantification in the workflow.   The present method is based on a multitasking formulation of reactive inverse problems combining data-driven and physics-informed techniques in calcite dissolution. This allows quantifying morphological uncertainties on the porosity field and estimating reactive parameter ranges through prescribed PDE models with a latent concentration field and dynamical microCT. The data assimilation strategy relies on sequential reinforcement incorporating successively additional PDE constraints. We guarantee robust and unbiased uncertainty quantification by straightforward adaptive weighting of Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks (BPINNs), ensuring reliable micro-porosity changes during geochemical transformations. We demonstrate successful Bayesian Inference in 1D+Time and 2D+Time calcite dissolution based on synthetic microCT images with meaningful posterior distribution on the reactive parameters and dimensionless numbers.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Passive acoustic monitoring can be an effective way of monitoring wildlife populations that are acoustically active but difficult to survey visually. Digital recorders allow surveyors to gather large volumes of data at low cost, but identifying target species vocalisations in these data is non-trivial. Machine learning (ML) methods are often used to do the identification. They can process large volumes of data quickly, but they do not detect all vocalisations and they do generate some false positives (vocalisations that are not from the target species). Existing wildlife abundance survey methods have been designed specifically to deal with the first of these mistakes, but current methods of dealing with false positives are not well-developed. They do not take account of features of individual vocalisations, some of which are more likely to be false positives than others. We propose three methods for acoustic spatial capture-recapture inference that integrate individual-level measures of confidence from ML vocalisation identification into the likelihood and hence integrate ML uncertainty into inference. The methods include a mixture model in which species identity is a latent variable. We test the methods by simulation and find that in a scenario based on acoustic data from Hainan gibbons, in which ignoring false positives results in 17% positive bias, our methods give negligible bias and coverage probabilities that are close to the nominal 95% level.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Fast adversarial training (FAT) is beneficial for improving the adversarial robustness of neural networks. However, previous FAT work has encountered a significant issue known as catastrophic overfitting when dealing with large perturbation budgets, \ie the adversarial robustness of models declines to near zero during training.   To address this, we analyze the training process of prior FAT work and observe that catastrophic overfitting is accompanied by the appearance of loss convergence outliers.   Therefore, we argue a moderately smooth loss convergence process will be a stable FAT process that solves catastrophic overfitting.   To obtain a smooth loss convergence process, we propose a novel oscillatory constraint (dubbed ConvergeSmooth) to limit the loss difference between adjacent epochs. The convergence stride of ConvergeSmooth is introduced to balance convergence and smoothing. Likewise, we design weight centralization without introducing additional hyperparameters other than the loss balance coefficient.   Our proposed methods are attack-agnostic and thus can improve the training stability of various FAT techniques.   Extensive experiments on popular datasets show that the proposed methods efficiently avoid catastrophic overfitting and outperform all previous FAT methods.

<p>Abstract:<br>Some applications of deep learning require not only to provide accurate results but also to quantify the amount of confidence in their prediction. The management of an electric power grid is one of these cases: to avoid risky scenarios, decision-makers need both precise and reliable forecasts of, for example, power loads. For this reason, point forecasts are not enough hence it is necessary to adopt methods that provide an uncertainty quantification.   This work focuses on reservoir computing as the core time series forecasting method, due to its computational efficiency and effectiveness in predicting time series. While the RC literature mostly focused on point forecasting, this work explores the compatibility of some popular uncertainty quantification methods with the reservoir setting. Both Bayesian and deterministic approaches to uncertainty assessment are evaluated and compared in terms of their prediction accuracy, computational resource efficiency and reliability of the estimated uncertainty, based on a set of carefully chosen performance metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In this paper, we investigate the operation of an aerial manipulator system, namely an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with a controllable arm with two degrees of freedom to carry out actuation tasks on the fly. Our solution is based on employing a Q-learning method to control the trajectory of the tip of the arm, also called \textit{end-effector}. More specifically, we develop a motion planning model based on Time To Collision (TTC), which enables a quadrotor UAV to navigate around obstacles while ensuring the manipulator’s reachability. Additionally, we utilize a model-based Q-learning model to independently track and control the desired trajectory of the manipulator’s end-effector, given an arbitrary baseline trajectory for the UAV platform. Such a combination enables a variety of actuation tasks such as high-altitude welding, structural monitoring and repair, battery replacement, gutter cleaning, sky scrapper cleaning, and power line maintenance in hard-to-reach and risky environments while retaining compatibility with flight control firmware. Our RL-based control mechanism results in a robust control strategy that can handle uncertainties in the motion of the UAV, offering promising performance. Specifically, our method achieves 92% accuracy in terms of average displacement error (i.e. the mean distance between the target and obtained trajectory points) using Q-learning with 15,000 episodes</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Public transport routing plays a crucial role in transit network design, ensuring a satisfactory level of service for passengers. However, current routing solutions rely on traditional operational research heuristics, which can be time-consuming to implement and lack the ability to provide quick solutions. Here, we propose a novel deep learning-based methodology for a decision support system that enables public transport (PT) planners to identify short-term route improvements rapidly. By seamlessly adjusting specific sections of routes between two stops during specific times of the day, our method effectively reduces times and enhances PT services. Leveraging diverse data sources such as GTFS and smart card data, we extract features and model the transportation network as a directed graph. Using self-supervision, we train a deep learning model for predicting lateness values for road segments.   These lateness values are then utilized as edge weights in the transportation graph, enabling efficient path searching. Through evaluating the method on Tel Aviv, we are able to reduce times on more than 9% of the routes. The improved routes included both intraurban and suburban routes showcasing a fact highlighting the model’s versatility. The findings emphasize the potential of our data-driven decision support system to enhance public transport and city logistics, promoting greater efficiency and reliability in PT services.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Machine learning models are often used to decide who will receive a loan, a job interview, or a public benefit. Standard techniques to build these models use features about people but overlook their actionability. In turn, models can assign predictions that are fixed, meaning that consumers who are denied loans, interviews, or benefits may be permanently locked out from access to credit, employment, or assistance. In this work, we introduce a formal testing procedure to flag models that assign fixed predictions that we call recourse verification. We develop machinery to reliably determine if a given model can provide recourse to its decision subjects from a set of user-specified actionability constraints. We demonstrate how our tools can ensure recourse and adversarial robustness in real-world datasets and use them to study the infeasibility of recourse in real-world lending datasets. Our results highlight how models can inadvertently assign fixed predictions that permanently bar access, and we provide tools to design algorithms that account for actionability when developing models.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Deep neural networks (NNs) are known for their high-prediction performances. However, NNs are prone to yield unreliable predictions when encountering completely new situations without indicating their uncertainty. Bayesian variants of NNs (BNNs), such as Monte Carlo (MC) dropout BNNs, do provide uncertainty measures and simultaneously increase the prediction performance. The only disadvantage of BNNs is their higher computation time during test time because they rely on a sampling approach. Here we present a single-shot MC dropout approximation that preserves the advantages of BNNs while being as fast as NNs. Our approach is based on moment propagation (MP) and allows to analytically approximate the expected value and the variance of the MC dropout signal for commonly used layers in NNs, i.e. convolution, max pooling, dense, softmax, and dropout layers. The MP approach can convert an NN into a BNN without re-training given the NN has been trained with standard dropout. We evaluate our approach on different benchmark datasets and a simulated toy example in a classification and regression setting. We demonstrate that our single-shot MC dropout approximation resembles the point estimate and the uncertainty estimate of the predictive distribution that is achieved with an MC approach, while being fast enough for real-time deployments of BNNs. We show that using part of the saved time to combine our MP approach with deep ensemble techniques does further improve the uncertainty measures.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Robot control using reinforcement learning has become popular, but its learning process generally terminates halfway through an episode for safety and time-saving reasons. This study addresses the problem of the most popular exception handling that temporal-difference (TD) learning performs at such termination. That is, by forcibly assuming zero value after termination, unintentionally implicit underestimation or overestimation occurs, depending on the reward design in the normal states. When the episode is terminated due to task failure, the failure may be highly valued with the unintentional overestimation, and the wrong policy may be acquired. Although this problem can be avoided by paying attention to the reward design, it is essential in practical use of TD learning to review the exception handling at termination. This paper therefore proposes a method to intentionally underestimate the value after termination to avoid learning failures due to the unintentional overestimation. In addition, the degree of underestimation is adjusted according to the degree of stationarity at termination, thereby preventing excessive exploration due to the intentional underestimation. Simulations and real robot experiments showed that the proposed method can stably obtain the optimal policies for various tasks and reward designs. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/AxXr8uFOe7M">https://youtu.be/AxXr8uFOe7M</a></p>

<p>Abstract:<br>A prevalent practice in recommender systems consists of averaging item embeddings to represent users or higher-level concepts in the same embedding space. This paper investigates the relevance of such a practice. For this purpose, we propose an expected precision score, designed to measure the consistency of an average embedding relative to the items used for its construction. We subsequently analyze the mathematical expression of this score in a theoretical setting with specific assumptions, as well as its empirical behavior on real-world data from music streaming services. Our results emphasize that real-world averages are less consistent for recommendation, which paves the way for future research to better align real-world embeddings with assumptions from our theoretical setting.</p>

However, limited memory capacity is one of the most common drawbacks of processing high-resolution 3D volumetric data. 3D volumes are usually cropped or downsized first before processing, which can result in a loss of resolution, increase class imbalance, and affect the performance of the segmentation algorithms. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning approach called IP-UNet. IP-UNet is a UNet-based model that performs multi-class segmentation on Intensity Projection (IP) of 3D volumetric data instead of the memory-consuming 3D volumes. IP-UNet uses limited memory capability for training without losing the original 3D image resolution. We compare the performance of three models in terms of segmentation accuracy and computational cost: 1) Slice-by-slice 2D segmentation of the CT scan images using a conventional 2D UNet model. 2) IP-UNet that operates on data obtained by merging the extracted Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP), Closest Vessel Projection (CVP), and Average Intensity Projection (AvgIP) representations of the source 3D volumes, then applying the UNet model on the output IP images. 3) 3D-UNet model directly reads the 3D volumes constructed from a series of CT scan images and outputs the 3D volume of the predicted segmentation. We test the performance of these methods on 3D volumetric images for automatic breast calcification detection. Experimental results show that IP-Unet can achieve similar segmentation accuracy with 3D-Unet but with much better performance. It reduces the training time by 70% and memory consumption by 92%.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper introduces a novel data-driven motion in-betweening system to reach target poses of characters by making use of phases variables learned by a Periodic Autoencoder. Our approach utilizes a mixture-of-experts neural network model, in which the phases cluster movements in both space and time with different expert weights. Each generated set of weights then produces a sequence of poses in an autoregressive manner between the current and target state of the character. In addition, to satisfy poses which are manually modified by the animators or where certain end effectors serve as constraints to be reached by the animation, a learned bi-directional control scheme is implemented to satisfy such constraints. The results demonstrate that using phases for motion in-betweening tasks sharpen the interpolated movements, and furthermore stabilizes the learning process. Moreover, using phases for motion in-betweening tasks can also synthesize more challenging movements beyond locomotion behaviors. Additionally, style control is enabled between given target keyframes. Our proposed framework can compete with popular state-of-the-art methods for motion in-betweening in terms of motion quality and generalization, especially in the existence of long transition durations. Our framework contributes to faster prototyping workflows for creating animated character sequences, which is of enormous interest for the game and film industry.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>An important application of Synthetic Biology is the engineering of the host cell system to yield useful products. However, an increase in the scale of the host system leads to huge design space and requires a large number of validation trials with high experimental costs. A comprehensible machine learning approach that efficiently explores the hypothesis space and guides experimental design is urgently needed for the Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) cycle of the host cell system. We introduce a novel machine learning framework ILP-iML1515 based on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) that performs abductive logical reasoning and actively learns from training examples. In contrast to numerical models, ILP-iML1515 is built on comprehensible logical representations of a genome-scale metabolic model and can update the model by learning new logical structures from auxotrophic mutant trials. The ILP-iML1515 framework 1) allows high-throughput simulations and 2) actively selects experiments that reduce the experimental cost of learning gene functions in comparison to randomly selected experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>There are growing implications surrounding generative AI in the speech domain that enable voice cloning and real-time voice conversion from one individual to another. This technology poses a significant ethical threat and could lead to breaches of privacy and misrepresentation, thus there is an urgent need for real-time detection of AI-generated speech for DeepFake Voice Conversion. To address the above emerging issues, the DEEP-VOICE dataset is generated in this study, comprised of real human speech from eight well-known figures and their speech converted to one another using Retrieval-based Voice Conversion. Presenting as a binary classification problem of whether the speech is real or AI-generated, statistical analysis of temporal audio features through t-testing reveals that there are significantly different distributions. Hyperparameter optimisation is implemented for machine learning models to identify the source of speech. Following the training of 208 individual machine learning models over 10-fold cross validation, it is found that the Extreme Gradient Boosting model can achieve an average classification accuracy of 99.3% and can classify speech in real-time, at around 0.004 milliseconds given one second of speech. All data generated for this study is released publicly for future research on AI speech detection.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Customer lifetime value (LTV) prediction is essential for mobile game publishers trying to optimize the advertising investment for each user acquisition based on the estimated worth. In mobile games, deploying microtransactions is a simple yet effective monetization strategy, which attracts a tiny group of game whales who splurge on in-game purchases. The presence of such game whales may impede the practicality of existing LTV prediction models, since game whales’ purchase behaviours always exhibit varied distribution from general users. Consequently, identifying game whales can open up new opportunities to improve the accuracy of LTV prediction models. However, little attention has been paid to applying game whale detection in LTV prediction, and existing works are mainly specialized for the long-term LTV prediction with the assumption that the high-quality user features are available, which is not applicable in the UA stage. In this paper, we propose ExpLTV, a novel multi-task framework to perform LTV prediction and game whale detection in a unified way. In ExpLTV, we first innovatively design a deep neural network-based game whale detector that can not only infer the intrinsic order in accordance with monetary value, but also precisely identify high spenders (i.e., game whales) and low spenders. Then, by treating the game whale detector as a gating network to decide the different mixture patterns of LTV experts assembling, we can thoroughly leverage the shared information and scenario-specific information (i.e., game whales modelling and low spenders modelling). Finally, instead of separately designing a purchase rate estimator for two tasks, we design a shared estimator that can preserve the inner task relationships. The superiority of ExpLTV is further validated via extensive experiments on three industrial datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) is a viable approach to enhance a player’s experience in video games. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have been employed for DDA in non-competitive games; nevertheless, they rely solely on discrete state-action space with a small search space. In this paper, we propose a continuous RL-based DDA methodology for a visual working memory (VWM) game to handle the complex search space for the difficulty of memorization. The proposed RL-based DDA tailors game difficulty based on the player’s score and game difficulty in the last trial. We defined a continuous metric for the difficulty of memorization. Then, we consider the task difficulty and the vector of difficulty-score as the RL’s action and state, respectively. We evaluated the proposed method through a within-subject experiment involving 52 subjects. The proposed approach was compared with two rule-based difficulty adjustment methods in terms of player’s score and game experience measured by a questionnaire. The proposed RL-based approach resulted in a significantly better game experience in terms of competence, tension, and negative and positive affect. Players also achieved higher scores and win rates. Furthermore, the proposed RL-based DDA led to a significantly less decline in the score in a 20-trial session.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper explores the ability of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve forward and inverse problems of contact mechanics for small deformation elasticity. We deploy PINNs in a mixed-variable formulation enhanced by output transformation to enforce Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions as hard constraints. Inequality constraints of contact problems, namely Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) type conditions, are enforced as soft constraints by incorporating them into the loss function during network training. To formulate the loss function contribution of KKT constraints, existing approaches applied to elastoplasticity problems are investigated and we explore a nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) function, namely Fischer-Burmeister, which possesses advantageous characteristics in terms of optimization. Based on the Hertzian contact problem, we show that PINNs can serve as pure partial differential equation (PDE) solver, as data-enhanced forward model, as inverse solver for parameter identification, and as fast-to-evaluate surrogate model. Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of choosing proper hyperparameters, e.g. loss weights, and a combination of Adam and L-BFGS-B optimizers aiming for better results in terms of accuracy and training time.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We propose TopDis (Topological Disentanglement), a method for learning disentangled representations via adding multi-scale topological loss term. Disentanglement is a crucial property of data representations substantial for the explainability and robustness of deep learning models and a step towards high-level cognition. The state-of-the-art method based on VAE minimizes the total correlation of the joint distribution of latent variables. We take a different perspective on disentanglement by analyzing topological properties of data manifolds. In particular, we optimize the topological similarity for data manifolds traversals. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first one to propose a differentiable topological loss for disentanglement. Our experiments have shown that the proposed topological loss improves disentanglement scores such as MIG, FactorVAE score, SAP score and DCI disentanglement score with respect to state-of-the-art results. Our method works in an unsupervised manner, permitting to apply it for problems without labeled factors of variation. Additionally, we show how to use the proposed topological loss to find disentangled directions in a trained GAN.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper introduces a new data analysis method for big data using a newly defined regression model named multiple model linear regression(MMLR), which separates input datasets into subsets and construct local linear regression models of them. The proposed data analysis method is shown to be more efficient and flexible than other regression based methods. This paper also proposes an approximate algorithm to construct MMLR models based on $(\epsilon,\delta)$-estimator, and gives mathematical proofs of the correctness and efficiency of MMLR algorithm, of which the time complexity is linear with respect to the size of input datasets. This paper also empirically implements the method on both synthetic and real-world datasets, the algorithm shows to have comparable performance to existing regression methods in many cases, while it takes almost the shortest time to provide a high prediction accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>While large volumes of unlabeled data are usually available, associated labels are often scarce. The unsupervised domain adaptation problem aims at exploiting labels from a source domain to classify data from a related, yet different, target domain. When time series are at stake, new difficulties arise as temporal shifts may appear in addition to the standard feature distribution shift. In this paper, we introduce the Match-And-Deform (MAD) approach that aims at finding correspondences between the source and target time series while allowing temporal distortions. The associated optimization problem simultaneously aligns the series thanks to an optimal transport loss and the time stamps through dynamic time warping. When embedded into a deep neural network, MAD helps learning new representations of time series that both align the domains and maximize the discriminative power of the network. Empirical studies on benchmark datasets and remote sensing data demonstrate that MAD makes meaningful sample-to-sample pairing and time shift estimation, reaching similar or better classification performance than state-of-the-art deep time series domain adaptation strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Federated learning (FL) is an emerging approach for training machine learning models collaboratively while preserving data privacy. The need for privacy protection makes it difficult for FL models to achieve global transparency and explainability. To address this limitation, we incorporate logic-based explanations into FL by proposing the Logical Reasoning-based eXplainable Federated Learning (LR-XFL) approach. Under LR-XFL, FL clients create local logic rules based on their local data and send them, along with model updates, to the FL server. The FL server connects the local logic rules through a proper logical connector that is derived based on properties of client data, without requiring access to the raw data. In addition, the server also aggregates the local model updates with weight values determined by the quality of the clients’ local data as reflected by their uploaded logic rules. The results show that LR-XFL outperforms the most relevant baseline by 1.19%, 5.81% and 5.41% in terms of classification accuracy, rule accuracy and rule fidelity, respectively. The explicit rule evaluation and expression under LR-XFL enable human experts to validate and correct the rules on the server side, hence improving the global FL model’s robustness to errors. It has the potential to enhance the transparency of FL models for areas like healthcare and finance where both data privacy and explainability are important.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We propose a novel master-slave architecture to solve the top-$K$ combinatorial multi-armed bandits problem with non-linear bandit feedback and diversity constraints, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first combinatorial bandits setting considering diversity constraints under bandit feedback. Specifically, to efficiently explore the combinatorial and constrained action space, we introduce six slave models with distinguished merits to generate diversified samples well balancing rewards and constraints as well as efficiency. Moreover, we propose teacher learning based optimization and the policy co-training technique to boost the performance of the multiple slave models. The master model then collects the elite samples provided by the slave models and selects the best sample estimated by a neural contextual UCB-based network to make a decision with a trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Thanks to the elaborate design of slave models, the co-training mechanism among slave models, and the novel interactions between the master and slave models, our approach significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art algorithms in both synthetic and real datasets for recommendation tasks.

<p>Abstract:<br>Accurate classification of white blood cells in peripheral blood is essential for diagnosing hematological diseases. Due to constantly evolving clinical settings, data sources, and disease classifications, it is necessary to update machine learning classification models regularly for practical real-world use. Such models significantly benefit from sequentially learning from incoming data streams without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. However, models can suffer from catastrophic forgetting, causing a drop in performance on previous tasks when fine-tuned on new data. Here, we propose a rehearsal-based continual learning approach for class incremental and domain incremental scenarios in white blood cell classification. To choose representative samples from previous tasks, we employ exemplar set selection based on the model’s predictions. This involves selecting the most confident samples and the most challenging samples identified through uncertainty estimation of the model. We thoroughly evaluated our proposed approach on three white blood cell classification datasets that differ in color, resolution, and class composition, including scenarios where new domains or new classes are introduced to the model with every task. We also test a long class incremental experiment with both new domains and new classes. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms established baselines in continual learning, including existing iCaRL and EWC methods for classifying white blood cells in cross-domain environments.</p>

Decision problems involving these systems are high-dimensional Markov decision processes (MDPs). We present a decomposition result that reduces such an MDP to two-dimensional MDPs, enabling structural analyses and computations. We leverage this decomposition to demonstrate that pooling data can lead to significant cost reductions compared to not pooling.</p>

We reframe this in the context of Information Geometry, where neural networks are studied as spaces of parameterized distributions with curved geometry. We hypothesize that shortest paths in these spaces, known as geodesics, correspond to mode-connecting paths in the loss landscape. We propose an algorithm to approximate geodesics and demonstrate that they achieve mode connectivity.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Assessing the robustness of deep neural networks against out-of-distribution inputs is crucial, especially in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving, but also in safety systems where malicious actors can digitally alter inputs to circumvent safety guards. However, designing effective out-of-distribution tests that encompass all possible scenarios while preserving accurate label information is a challenging task. Existing methodologies often entail a compromise between variety and constraint levels for attacks and sometimes even both. In a first step towards a more holistic robustness evaluation of image classification models, we introduce an attack method based on image solarization that is conceptually straightforward yet avoids jeopardizing the global structure of natural images independent of the intensity. Through comprehensive evaluations of multiple ImageNet models, we demonstrate the attack’s capacity to degrade accuracy significantly, provided it is not integrated into the training augmentations. Interestingly, even then, no full immunity to accuracy deterioration is achieved. In other settings, the attack can often be simplified into a black-box attack with model-independent parameters. Defenses against other corruptions do not consistently extend to be effective against our specific attack.

Our initial solution replaces the standard one-vs-all (softmax) discriminator with a one-vs-one (all pairs) discriminator and combines it with a novel intrinsic reward function and a dropout regularization technique. The combined approach is named APART: Diverse Skill Discovery using All Pairs with Ascending Reward and Dropout. We demonstrate that APART discovers all the possible skills in grid worlds with remarkably fewer samples than previous works. Motivated by the empirical success of APART, we further investigate an even simpler algorithm that achieves maximum skills by altering VIC, rescaling its intrinsic reward, and tuning the temperature of its softmax discriminator. We believe our findings shed light on the crucial factors underlying success of skill discovery algorithms in reinforcement learning.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper reports on the GENEA Challenge 2023, in which participating teams built speech-driven gesture-generation systems using the same speech and motion dataset, followed by a joint evaluation. This year’s challenge provided data on both sides of a dyadic interaction, allowing teams to generate full-body motion for an agent given its speech (text and audio) and the speech and motion of the interlocutor. We evaluated 12 submissions and 2 baselines together with held-out motion-capture data in several large-scale user studies. The studies focused on three aspects: 1) the human-likeness of the motion, 2) the appropriateness of the motion for the agent’s own speech whilst controlling for the human-likeness of the motion, and 3) the appropriateness of the motion for the behaviour of the interlocutor in the interaction, using a setup that controls for both the human-likeness of the motion and the agent’s own speech. We found a large span in human-likeness between challenge submissions, with a few systems rated close to human mocap. Appropriateness seems far from being solved, with most submissions performing in a narrow range slightly above chance, far behind natural motion. The effect of the interlocutor is even more subtle, with submitted systems at best performing barely above chance. Interestingly, a dyadic system being highly appropriate for agent speech does not necessarily imply high appropriateness for the interlocutor.

<p>Abstract:<br>The classification of gigapixel histopathology images with deep multiple instance learning models has become a critical task in digital pathology and precision medicine. In this work, we propose a Transformer-based multiple instance learning approach that replaces the traditional learned attention mechanism with a regional, Vision Transformer inspired self-attention mechanism. We present a method that fuses regional patch information to derive slide-level predictions and show how this regional aggregation can be stacked to hierarchically process features on different distance levels. To increase predictive accuracy, especially for datasets with small, local morphological features, we introduce a method to focus the image processing on high attention regions during inference. Our approach is able to significantly improve performance over the baseline on two histopathology datasets and points towards promising directions for further research.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Logs are valuable information for oil and gas fields as they help to determine the lithology of the formations surrounding the borehole and the location and reserves of subsurface oil and gas reservoirs. However, important logs are often missing in horizontal or old wells, which poses a challenge in field applications. In this paper, we utilize data from the 2020 machine learning competition of the SPWLA, which aims to predict the missing compressional wave slowness and shear wave slowness logs using other logs in the same borehole. We employ the NGBoost algorithm to construct an Ensemble Learning model that can predicate the results as well as their uncertainty. Furthermore, we combine the SHAP method to investigate the interpretability of the machine learning model. We compare the performance of the NGBosst model with four other commonly used Ensemble Learning methods, including Random Forest, GBDT, XGBoost, LightGBM. The results show that the NGBoost model performs well in the testing set and can provide a probability distribution for the prediction results. In addition, the variance of the probability distribution of the predicted log can be used to justify the quality of the constructed log. Using the SHAP explainable machine learning model, we calculate the importance of each input log to the predicted results as well as the coupling relationship among input logs. Our findings reveal that the NGBoost model tends to provide greater slowness prediction results when the neutron porosity and gamma ray are large, which is consistent with the cognition of petrophysical models. Furthermore, the machine learning model can capture the influence of the changing borehole caliper on slowness, where the influence of borehole caliper on slowness is complex and not easy to establish a direct relationship. These findings are in line with the physical principle of borehole acoustics.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The rapid growth of deep learning (DL) has spurred interest in enhancing log-based anomaly detection. This approach aims to extract meaning from log events (log message templates) and develop advanced DL models for anomaly detection. However, these DL methods face challenges like heavy reliance on training data, labels, and computational resources due to model complexity. In contrast, traditional machine learning and data mining techniques are less data-dependent and more efficient but less effective than DL. To make log-based anomaly detection more practical, the goal is to enhance traditional techniques to match DL’s effectiveness. Previous research in a different domain (linking questions on Stack Overflow) suggests that optimized traditional techniques can rival state-of-the-art DL methods. Drawing inspiration from this concept, we conducted an empirical study. We optimized the unsupervised PCA (Principal Component Analysis), a traditional technique, by incorporating lightweight semantic-based log representation. This addresses the issue of unseen log events in training data, enhancing log representation. Our study compared seven log-based anomaly detection methods, including four DL-based, two traditional, and the optimized PCA technique, using public and industrial datasets. Results indicate that the optimized unsupervised PCA technique achieves similar effectiveness to advanced supervised&#x2F;semi-supervised DL methods while being more stable with limited training data and resource-efficient. This demonstrates the adaptability and strength of traditional techniques through small yet impactful adaptations.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Customer retention or churn prevention is a challenging task of a telecom operator. One of the effective approaches is to offer some attractive incentive or additional services or money to the subscribers for keeping them engaged and make sure they stay in the operator’s network for longer time. Often, operators allocate certain amount of monetary budget to carry out the offer campaign. The difficult part of this campaign is the selection of a set of customers from a large subscriber-base and deciding the amount that should be offered to an individual so that operator’s objective is achieved. There may be multiple objectives (e.g., maximizing revenue, minimizing number of churns) for selection of subscriber and selection of an offer to the selected subscriber. Apart from monetary benefit, offers may include additional data, SMS, hots-spot tethering, and many more. This problem is known as offer optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel combinatorial algorithm for solving offer optimization under heterogeneous offers by maximizing expected revenue under the scenario of subscriber churn, which is, in general, seen in telecom domain. The proposed algorithm is efficient and accurate even for a very large subscriber-base.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>With the proliferation of video platforms on the internet, recording musical performances by mobile devices has become commonplace. However, these recordings often suffer from degradation such as noise and reverberation, which negatively impact the listening experience. Consequently, the necessity for music audio enhancement (referred to as music enhancement from this point onward), involving the transformation of degraded audio recordings into pristine high-quality music, has surged to augment the auditory experience. To address this issue, we propose a music enhancement system based on the Conformer architecture that has demonstrated outstanding performance in speech enhancement tasks. Our approach explores the attention mechanisms of the Conformer and examines their performance to discover the best approach for the music enhancement task. Our experimental results show that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-stem music enhancement. Furthermore, our system can perform general music enhancement with multi-track mixtures, which has not been examined in previous work.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Handling entirely unknown data is a challenge for any deployed classifier. Classification models are typically trained on a static pre-defined dataset and are kept in the dark for the open unassigned feature space. As a result, they struggle to deal with out-of-distribution data during inference. Addressing this task on the class-level is termed open-set recognition (OSR). However, most OSR methods are inherently limited, as they train closed-set classifiers and only adapt the downstream predictions to OSR. This work presents LORD, a framework to Leverage Open-set Recognition by exploiting unknown Data. LORD explicitly models open space during classifier training and provides a systematic evaluation for such approaches. We identify three model-agnostic training strategies that exploit background data and applied them to well-established classifiers. Due to LORD’s extensive evaluation protocol, we consistently demonstrate improved recognition of unknown data. The benchmarks facilitate in-depth analysis across various requirement levels. To mitigate dependency on extensive and costly background datasets, we explore mixup as an off-the-shelf data generation technique. Our experiments highlight mixup’s effectiveness as a substitute for background datasets. Lightweight constraints on mixup synthesis further improve OSR performance.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Neural dynamical systems with stable attractor structures, such as point attractors and continuous attractors, are hypothesized to underlie meaningful temporal behavior that requires working memory. However, working memory may not support useful learning signals necessary to adapt to changes in the temporal structure of the environment. We show that in addition to the continuous attractors that are widely implicated, periodic and quasi-periodic attractors can also support learning arbitrarily long temporal relationships. Unlike the continuous attractors that suffer from the fine-tuning problem, the less explored quasi-periodic attractors are uniquely qualified for learning to produce temporally structured behavior. Our theory has broad implications for the design of artificial learning systems and makes predictions about observable signatures of biological neural dynamics that can support temporal dependence learning and working memory. Based on our theory, we developed a new initialization scheme for artificial recurrent neural networks that outperforms standard methods for tasks that require learning temporal dynamics. Moreover, we propose a robust recurrent memory mechanism for integrating and maintaining head direction without a ring attractor.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Federated learning systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To combat this, we introduce a novel aggregator based on Huber loss minimization, and provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) assumption, our approach has several advantages compared to existing methods. Firstly, it has optimal dependence on $\epsilon$, which stands for the ratio of attacked clients. Secondly, our approach does not need precise knowledge of $\epsilon$. Thirdly, it allows different clients to have unequal data sizes. We then broaden our analysis to include non-i.i.d data, such that clients have slightly different distributions.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is one of the most important parts of a hospital, which admits critically ill patients and provides continuous monitoring and treatment. Various patient outcome prediction methods have been attempted to assist healthcare professionals in clinical decision-making. Existing methods focus on measuring the similarity between patients using deep neural networks to capture the hidden feature structures. However, the higher-order relationships are ignored, such as patient characteristics (e.g., diagnosis codes) and their causal effects on downstream clinical predictions.   In this paper, we propose a novel Hypergraph Convolutional Network that allows the representation of non-pairwise relationships among diagnosis codes in a hypergraph to capture the hidden feature structures so that fine-grained patient similarity can be calculated for personalized mortality risk prediction. Evaluation using a publicly available eICU Collaborative Research Database indicates that our method achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art models on mortality risk prediction. Moreover, the results of several case studies demonstrated the effectiveness of constructing graph networks in providing good transparency and robustness in decision-making.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Imitation Learning (IL) is an important paradigm within the broader reinforcement learning (RL) methodology. Unlike most of RL, it does not assume availability of reward-feedback. Reward inference and shaping are known to be difficult and error-prone methods particularly when the demonstration data comes from human experts. Classical methods such as behavioral cloning and inverse reinforcement learning are highly sensitive to estimation errors, a problem that is particularly acute in continuous state space problems. Meanwhile, state-of-the-art IL algorithms convert behavioral policy learning problems into distribution-matching problems which often require additional online interaction data to be effective. In this paper, we consider the problem of imitation learning in continuous state space environments based solely on observed behavior, without access to transition dynamics information, reward structure, or, most importantly, any additional interactions with the environment. Our approach is based on the Markov balance equation and introduces a novel conditional kernel density estimation-based imitation learning framework. It involves estimating the environment’s transition dynamics using conditional kernel density estimators and seeks to satisfy the probabilistic balance equations for the environment. We establish that our estimators satisfy basic asymptotic consistency requirements. Through a series of numerical experiments on continuous state benchmark environments, we show consistently superior empirical performance over many state-of-the-art IL algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Mainstream unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms often excel in academic datasets, yet their real-world performance is restricted due to the controlled experimental conditions involving clean training data. Addressing the challenge of training with noise, a prevalent issue in practical anomaly detection, is frequently overlooked. In a pioneering endeavor, this study delves into the realm of label-level noise within sensory time-series anomaly detection (TSAD). This paper presents a novel and practical end-to-end unsupervised TSAD when the training data are contaminated with anomalies. The introduced approach, called TSAD-C, is devoid of access to abnormality labels during the training phase. TSAD-C encompasses three modules: a Decontaminator to rectify the abnormalities (aka noise) present in the training data, a Variable Dependency Modeling module to capture both long-term intra- and inter-variable dependencies within the decontaminated data that can be considered as a surrogate of the pure normal data, and an Anomaly Scoring module to detect anomalies. Our extensive experiments conducted on three widely used physiological datasets conclusively demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing methodologies, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art performance in the field.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Variational Information Pursuit (V-IP) is a framework for making interpretable predictions by design by sequentially selecting a short chain of task-relevant, user-defined and interpretable queries about the data that are most informative for the task. While this allows for built-in interpretability in predictive models, applying V-IP to any task requires data samples with dense concept-labeling by domain experts, limiting the application of V-IP to small-scale tasks where manual data annotation is feasible. In this work, we extend the V-IP framework with Foundational Models (FMs) to address this limitation. More specifically, we use a two-step process, by first leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a sufficiently large candidate set of task-relevant interpretable concepts, then using Large Multimodal Models to annotate each data sample by semantic similarity with each concept in the generated concept set. While other interpretable-by-design frameworks such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) require an additional step of removing repetitive and non-discriminative concepts to have good interpretability and test performance, we mathematically and empirically justify that, with a sufficiently informative and task-relevant query (concept) set, the proposed FM+V-IP method does not require any type of concept filtering. In addition, we show that FM+V-IP with LLM generated concepts can achieve better test performance than V-IP with human annotated concepts, demonstrating the effectiveness of LLMs at generating efficient query sets. Finally, when compared to other interpretable-by-design frameworks such as CBMs, FM+V-IP can achieve competitive test performance using fewer number of concepts&#x2F;queries in both cases with filtered or unfiltered concept sets.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In order to coordinate energy interactions among various communities and energy conversions among multi-energy subsystems within the multi-community integrated energy system under uncertain conditions, and achieve overall optimization and scheduling of the comprehensive energy system, this paper proposes a comprehensive scheduling model that utilizes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn load characteristics of different communities and make decisions based on this knowledge. In this model, the scheduling problem of the integrated energy system is transformed into a Markov decision process and solved using a data-driven deep reinforcement learning algorithm, which avoids the need for modeling complex energy coupling relationships between multi-communities and multi-energy subsystems. The simulation results show that the proposed method effectively captures the load characteristics of different communities and utilizes their complementary features to coordinate reasonable energy interactions among them. This leads to a reduction in wind curtailment rate from 16.3% to 0% and lowers the overall operating cost by 5445.6 Yuan, demonstrating significant economic and environmental benefits.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Common explanations for shortcut learning assume that the shortcut improves prediction under the training distribution but not in the test distribution. Thus, models trained via the typical gradient-based optimization of cross-entropy, which we call default-ERM, utilize the shortcut. However, even when the stable feature determines the label in the training distribution and the shortcut does not provide any additional information, like in perception tasks, default-ERM still exhibits shortcut learning. Why are such solutions preferred when the loss for default-ERM can be driven to zero using the stable feature alone? By studying a linear perception task, we show that default-ERM’s preference for maximizing the margin leads to models that depend more on the shortcut than the stable feature, even without overparameterization. This insight suggests that default-ERM’s implicit inductive bias towards max-margin is unsuitable for perception tasks. Instead, we develop an inductive bias toward uniform margins and show that this bias guarantees dependence only on the perfect stable feature in the linear perception task. We develop loss functions that encourage uniform-margin solutions, called margin control (MARG-CTRL). MARG-CTRL mitigates shortcut learning on a variety of vision and language tasks, showing that better inductive biases can remove the need for expensive two-stage shortcut-mitigating methods in perception tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In this work, we focus on robust time series representation learning. Our assumption is that real-world time series is noisy and complementary information from different views of the same time series plays an important role while analyzing noisy input. Based on this, we create two views for the input time series through two different encoders. We conduct co-training based contrastive learning iteratively to learn the encoders. Our experiments demonstrate that this co-training approach leads to a significant improvement in performance. Especially, by leveraging the complementary information from different views, our proposed TS-CoT method can mitigate the impact of data noise and corruption. Empirical evaluations on four time series benchmarks in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings reveal that TS-CoT outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, the representations learned by TS-CoT can transfer well to downstream tasks through fine-tuning.</p>

Prior bias measurement datasets are sensitive to perturbations in their manually designed templates, therefore unreliable. To achieve reliability, we introduce the Comprehensive Assessment of Language Model bias (CALM), a benchmark dataset to quantify bias in LMs across three tasks. We integrate 16 existing datasets across different domains, such as Wikipedia and news articles, to filter 224 templates from which we construct a dataset of 78,400 examples. We compare the diversity of CALM with prior datasets on metrics such as average semantic similarity, and variation in template length, and test the sensitivity to small perturbations. We show that our dataset is more diverse and reliable than previous datasets, thus better capture the breadth of linguistic variation required to reliably evaluate model bias. We evaluate 20 large language models including six prominent families of LMs such as Llama-2. In two LM series, OPT and Bloom, we found that larger parameter models are more biased than lower parameter models. We found the T0 series of models to be the least biased. Furthermore, we noticed a tradeoff between gender and racial bias with increasing model size in some model series.

<p>Abstract:<br>Federated Learning (FL) aggregates locally trained models from individual clients to construct a global model. While FL enables learning a model with data privacy, it often suffers from significant performance degradation when client data distributions are heterogeneous. Many previous FL algorithms have addressed this issue by introducing various proximal restrictions. These restrictions aim to encourage global alignment by constraining the deviation of local learning from the global objective. However, they inherently limit local learning by interfering with the original local objectives. Recently, an alternative approach has emerged to improve local learning generality. By obtaining local models within a smooth loss landscape, this approach mitigates conflicts among different local objectives of the clients. Yet, it does not ensure stable global alignment, as local learning does not take the global objective into account. In this study, we propose Federated Stability on Learning (FedSoL), which combines both the concepts of global alignment and local generality. In FedSoL, the local learning seeks a parameter region robust against proximal perturbations. This strategy introduces an implicit proximal restriction effect in local learning while maintaining the original local objective for parameter update. Our experiments show that FedSoL consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on various setups.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Meshes are widely used in 3D computer vision and graphics, but their irregular topology poses challenges in applying them to existing neural network architectures. Recent advances in mesh neural networks turn to remeshing and push the boundary of pioneer methods that solely take the raw meshes as input. Although the remeshing offers a regular topology that significantly facilitates the design of mesh network architectures, features extracted from such remeshed proxies may struggle to retain the underlying geometry faithfully, limiting the subsequent neural network’s capacity. To address this issue, we propose SieveNet, a novel paradigm that takes into account both the regular topology and the exact geometry. Specifically, this method utilizes structured mesh topology from remeshing and accurate geometric information from distortion-aware point sampling on the surface of the original mesh. Furthermore, our method eliminates the need for hand-crafted feature engineering and can leverage off-the-shelf network architectures such as the vision transformer. Comprehensive experimental results on classification and segmentation tasks well demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Several earlier studies have shown impressive control performance in complex robotic systems by designing the controller using a neural network and training it with model-free reinforcement learning. However, these outstanding controllers with natural motion style and high task performance are developed through extensive reward engineering, which is a highly laborious and time-consuming process of designing numerous reward terms and determining suitable reward coefficients. In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework for training neural network controllers for complex robotic systems consisting of both rewards and constraints. To let the engineers appropriately reflect their intent to constraints and handle them with minimal computation overhead, two constraint types and an efficient policy optimization algorithm are suggested. The learning framework is applied to train locomotion controllers for several legged robots with different morphology and physical attributes to traverse challenging terrains. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that performant controllers can be trained with significantly less reward engineering, by tuning only a single reward coefficient. Furthermore, a more straightforward and intuitive engineering process can be utilized, thanks to the interpretability and generalizability of constraints.

<p>Abstract:<br>Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to sequentially learn new classes while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previous knowledge. We propose to use Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) as efficient learners for CIL. MAEs were originally designed to learn useful representations through reconstructive unsupervised learning, and they can be easily integrated with a supervised loss for classification. Moreover, MAEs can reliably reconstruct original input images from randomly selected patches, which we use to store exemplars from past tasks more efficiently for CIL. We also propose a bilateral MAE framework to learn from image-level and embedding-level fusion, which produces better-quality reconstructed images and more stable representations. Our experiments confirm that our approach performs better than the state-of-the-art on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full.

<p>Abstract:<br>The rapid spread of false information and persistent manipulation attacks on online social networks (OSNs), often for political, ideological, or financial gain, has affected the openness of OSNs. While researchers from various disciplines have investigated different manipulation-triggering elements of OSNs (such as understanding information diffusion on OSNs or detecting automated behavior of accounts), these works have not been consolidated to present a comprehensive overview of the interconnections among these elements. Notably, user psychology, the prevalence of bots, and their tactics in relation to false information detection have been overlooked in previous research. To address this research gap, this paper synthesizes insights from various disciplines to provide a comprehensive analysis of the manipulation landscape. By integrating the primary elements of social media manipulation (SMM), including false information, bots, and malicious campaigns, we extensively examine each SMM element. Through a systematic investigation of prior research, we identify commonalities, highlight existing gaps, and extract valuable insights in the field. Our findings underscore the urgent need for interdisciplinary research to effectively combat social media manipulations, and our systematization can guide future research efforts and assist OSN providers in ensuring the safety and integrity of their platforms.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We study scaling convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically targeting Residual neural networks (ResNet), for analyzing electrocardiograms (ECGs). Although ECG signals are time-series data, CNN-based models have been shown to outperform other neural networks with different architectures in ECG analysis. However, most previous studies in ECG analysis have overlooked the importance of network scaling optimization, which significantly improves performance. We explored and demonstrated an efficient approach to scale ResNet by examining the effects of crucial parameters, including layer depth, the number of channels, and the convolution kernel size. Through extensive experiments, we found that a shallower network, a larger number of channels, and smaller kernel sizes result in better performance for ECG classifications. The optimal network scale might differ depending on the target task, but our findings provide insight into obtaining more efficient and accurate models with fewer computing resources or less time. In practice, we demonstrate that a narrower search space based on our findings leads to higher performance.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper presents a cost-effective, low-power approach to unintentional fall detection using knowledge distillation-based LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models to significantly improve accuracy. With a primary focus on analyzing time-series data collected from various sensors, the solution offers real-time detection capabilities, ensuring prompt and reliable identification of falls. The authors investigate fall detection models that are based on different sensors, comparing their accuracy rates and performance. Furthermore, they employ the technique of knowledge distillation to enhance the models’ precision, resulting in refined accurate configurations that consume lower power. As a result, this proposed solution presents a compelling avenue for the development of energy-efficient fall detection systems for future advancements in this critical domain.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Digitalizing real-world analog signals typically involves sampling in time and discretizing in amplitude. Subsequent signal reconstructions inevitably incur an error that depends on the amplitude resolution and the temporal density of the acquired samples. From an implementation viewpoint, consistent signal reconstruction methods have proven a profitable error-rate decay as the sampling rate increases. Despite that, these results are obtained under offline settings. Therefore, a research gap exists regarding methods for consistent signal reconstruction from data streams. This paper presents a method that consistently reconstructs streamed multivariate time series of quantization intervals under a zero-delay response requirement. On the other hand, previous work has shown that the temporal dependencies within univariate time series can be exploited to reduce the roughness of zero-delay signal reconstructions. This work shows that the spatiotemporal dependencies within multivariate time series can also be exploited to achieve improved results. Specifically, the spatiotemporal dependencies of the multivariate time series are learned, with the assistance of a recurrent neural network, to reduce the roughness of the signal reconstruction on average while ensuring consistency. Our experiments show that our proposed method achieves a favorable error-rate decay with the sampling rate compared to a similar but non-consistent reconstruction.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recent advances of generative learning models are accompanied by the growing interest in federated learning (FL) based on generative adversarial network (GAN) models. In the context of FL, GAN can capture the underlying client data structure, and regenerate samples resembling the original data distribution without compromising the private raw data. Although most existing GAN-based FL works focus on training a global model, Personalized FL (PFL) sometimes can be more effective in view of client data heterogeneity in terms of distinct data sample distributions, feature spaces, and labels. To cope with client heterogeneity in GAN-based FL, we propose a novel GAN sharing and aggregation strategy for PFL. The proposed PFL-GAN addresses the client heterogeneity in different scenarios. More specially, we first learn the similarity among clients and then develop an weighted collaborative data aggregation. The empirical results through the rigorous experimentation on several well-known datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PFL-GAN.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>While hundreds of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are now approved or cleared by the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), many studies have shown inconsistent generalization or latent bias, particularly for underrepresented populations. Some have proposed that generative AI could reduce the need for real data, but its utility in model development remains unclear. Skin disease serves as a useful case study in synthetic image generation due to the diversity of disease appearance, particularly across the protected attribute of skin tone. Here we show that latent diffusion models can scalably generate images of skin disease and that augmenting model training with these data improves performance in data-limited settings. These performance gains saturate at synthetic-to-real image ratios above 10:1 and are substantially smaller than the gains obtained from adding real images. As part of our analysis, we generate and analyze a new dataset of 458,920 synthetic images produced using several generation strategies. Our results suggest that synthetic data could serve as a force-multiplier for model development, but the collection of diverse real-world data remains the most important step to improve medical AI algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is increasingly applied in large-scale productions like Netflix and Facebook. As with most data-driven systems, DRL systems can exhibit undesirable behaviors due to environmental drifts, which often occur in constantly-changing production settings. Continual Learning (CL) is the inherent self-healing approach for adapting the DRL agent in response to the environment’s conditions shifts. However, successive shifts of considerable magnitude may cause the production environment to drift from its original state. Recent studies have shown that these environmental drifts tend to drive CL into long, or even unsuccessful, healing cycles, which arise from inefficiencies such as catastrophic forgetting, warm-starting failure, and slow convergence. In this paper, we propose Dr. DRL, an effective self-healing approach for DRL systems that integrates a novel mechanism of intentional forgetting into vanilla CL to overcome its main issues. Dr. DRL deliberately erases the DRL system’s minor behaviors to systematically prioritize the adaptation of the key problem-solving skills. Using well-established DRL algorithms, Dr. DRL is compared with vanilla CL on various drifted environments. Dr. DRL is able to reduce, on average, the healing time and fine-tuning episodes by, respectively, 18.74% and 17.72%. Dr. DRL successfully helps agents to adapt to 19.63% of drifted environments left unsolved by vanilla CL while maintaining and even enhancing by up to 45% the obtained rewards for drifted environments that are resolved by both approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The rapid tracer kinetics of rubidium-82 ($^{82}$Rb) and high variation of cross-frame distribution in dynamic cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) raise significant challenges for inter-frame motion correction, particularly for the early frames where conventional intensity-based image registration techniques are not applicable. Alternatively, a promising approach utilizes generative methods to handle the tracer distribution changes to assist existing registration methods. To improve frame-wise registration and parametric quantification, we propose a Temporally and Anatomically Informed Generative Adversarial Network (TAI-GAN) to transform the early frames into the late reference frame using an all-to-one mapping. Specifically, a feature-wise linear modulation layer encodes channel-wise parameters generated from temporal tracer kinetics information, and rough cardiac segmentations with local shifts serve as the anatomical information. We validated our proposed method on a clinical $^{82}$Rb PET dataset and found that our TAI-GAN can produce converted early frames with high image quality, comparable to the real reference frames. After TAI-GAN conversion, motion estimation accuracy and clinical myocardial blood flow (MBF) quantification were improved compared to using the original frames.

<p>Abstract:<br>We present a novel defense, against backdoor attacks on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), wherein adversaries covertly implant malicious behaviors (backdoors) into DNNs. Our defense falls within the category of post-development defenses that operate independently of how the model was generated. The proposed defense is built upon a novel reverse engineering approach that can directly extract backdoor functionality of a given backdoored model to a backdoor expert model. The approach is straightforward – finetuning the backdoored model over a small set of intentionally mislabeled clean samples, such that it unlearns the normal functionality while still preserving the backdoor functionality, and thus resulting in a model (dubbed a backdoor expert model) that can only recognize backdoor inputs. Based on the extracted backdoor expert model, we show the feasibility of devising highly accurate backdoor input detectors that filter out the backdoor inputs during model inference. Further augmented by an ensemble strategy with a finetuned auxiliary model, our defense, BaDExpert (Backdoor Input Detection with Backdoor Expert), effectively mitigates 16 SOTA backdoor attacks while minimally impacting clean utility. The effectiveness of BaDExpert has been verified on multiple datasets (CIFAR10, GTSRB and ImageNet) across various model architectures (ResNet, VGG, MobileNetV2 and Vision Transformer).</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL), leveraging Deep Learning (DL) in reinforcement learning, has shown significant potential in achieving human-level autonomy in a wide range of domains, including robotics, computer vision, and computer games. This potential justifies the enthusiasm and growing interest in DRL in both academia and industry. However, the community currently focuses mostly on the development phase of DRL systems, with little attention devoted to DRL deployment. In this paper, we propose an empirical study on Stack Overflow (SO), the most popular Q&amp;A forum for developers, to uncover and understand the challenges practitioners faced when deploying DRL systems. Specifically, we categorized relevant SO posts by deployment platforms: server&#x2F;cloud, mobile&#x2F;embedded system, browser, and game engine. After filtering and manual analysis, we examined 357 SO posts about DRL deployment, investigated the current state, and identified the challenges related to deploying DRL systems. Then, we investigate the prevalence and difficulty of these challenges. Results show that the general interest in DRL deployment is growing, confirming the study’s relevance and importance. Results also show that DRL deployment is more difficult than other DRL issues. Additionally, we built a taxonomy of 31 unique challenges in deploying DRL to different platforms. On all platforms, RL environment-related challenges are the most popular, and communication-related challenges are the most difficult among practitioners. We hope our study inspires future research and helps the community overcome the most common and difficult challenges practitioners face when deploying DRL systems.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) have rapidly evolved, necessitating comprehensive insights into their diverse components. However, a systematic literature review that emphasizes the Environmental, Sustainability, and Governance (ESG) components of DLT remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we selected 107 seed papers to build a citation network of 63,083 references and refined it to a corpus of 24,539 publications for analysis. Then, we labeled the named entities in 46 papers according to twelve top-level categories derived from an established technology taxonomy and enhanced the taxonomy by pinpointing DLT’s ESG elements. Leveraging transformer-based language models, we fine-tuned a pre-trained language model for a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task using our labeled dataset. We used our fine-tuned language model to distill the corpus to 505 key papers, facilitating a literature review via named entities and temporal graph analysis on DLT evolution in the context of ESG. Our contributions are a methodology to conduct a machine learning-driven systematic literature review in the DLT field, placing a special emphasis on ESG aspects. Furthermore, we present a first-of-its-kind NER dataset, composed of 54,808 named entities, designed for DLT and ESG-related explorations.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Accurately estimating parameters in complex nonlinear systems is crucial across scientific and engineering fields. We present a novel approach for parameter estimation using a neural network with the Huber loss function. This method taps into deep learning’s abilities to uncover parameters governing intricate behaviors in nonlinear equations. We validate our approach using synthetic data and predefined functions that model system dynamics. By training the neural network with noisy time series data, it fine-tunes the Huber loss function to converge to accurate parameters. We apply our method to damped oscillators, Van der Pol oscillators, Lotka-Volterra systems, and Lorenz systems under multiplicative noise. The trained neural network accurately estimates parameters, evident from closely matching latent dynamics. Comparing true and estimated trajectories visually reinforces our method’s precision and robustness. Our study underscores the Huber loss-guided neural network as a versatile tool for parameter estimation, effectively uncovering complex relationships in nonlinear systems. The method navigates noise and uncertainty adeptly, showcasing its adaptability to real-world challenges.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In data imputation, effectively addressing missing values is pivotal, especially in intricate datasets. This paper delves into the FIML Optimized Self-attention (FOSA) framework, an innovative approach that amalgamates the strengths of Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) estimation with the capabilities of self-attention neural networks. Our methodology commences with an initial estimation of missing values via FIML, subsequently refining these estimates by leveraging the self-attention mechanism. Our comprehensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets underscore FOSA’s pronounced advantages over traditional FIML techniques, encapsulating facets of accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability to diverse data structures. Intriguingly, even in scenarios where the Structural Equation Model (SEM) might be mis-specified, leading to suboptimal FIML estimates, the robust architecture of FOSA’s self-attention component adeptly rectifies and optimizes the imputation outcomes. Our empirical tests reveal that FOSA consistently delivers commendable predictions, even in the face of up to 40% random missingness, highlighting its robustness and potential for wide-scale applications in data imputation.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Open-set face recognition refers to a scenario in which biometric systems have incomplete knowledge of all existing subjects. Therefore, they are expected to prevent face samples of unregistered subjects from being identified as previously enrolled identities. This watchlist context adds an arduous requirement that calls for the dismissal of irrelevant faces by focusing mainly on subjects of interest. As a response, this work introduces a novel method that associates an ensemble of compact neural networks with a margin-based cost function that explores additional samples. Supplementary negative samples can be obtained from external databases or synthetically built at the representation level in training time with a new mix-up feature augmentation approach. Deep neural networks pre-trained on large face datasets serve as the preliminary feature extraction module. We carry out experiments on well-known LFW and IJB-C datasets where results show that the approach is able to boost closed and open-set identification rates.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>With the growing use of machine learning (ML) models in critical domains such as finance and healthcare, the need to offer recourse for those adversely affected by the decisions of ML models has become more important; individuals ought to be provided with recommendations on actions to take for improving their situation and thus receive a favorable decision. Prior work on sequential algorithmic recourse – which recommends a series of changes – focuses on action feasibility and uses the proximity of feature changes to determine action costs. However, the uncertainties of feature changes and the risk of higher than average costs in recourse have not been considered. It is undesirable if a recourse could (with some probability) result in a worse situation from which recovery requires an extremely high cost. It is essential to incorporate risks when computing and evaluating recourse. We call the recourse computed with such risk considerations as Safer Algorithmic Recourse (SafeAR). The objective is to empower people to choose a recourse based on their risk tolerance. In this work, we discuss and show how existing recourse desiderata can fail to capture the risk of higher costs. We present a method to compute recourse policies that consider variability in cost and connect algorithmic recourse literature with risk-sensitive reinforcement learning. We also adopt measures <code>Value at Risk&#39;&#39; and </code>Conditional Value at Risk’’ from the financial literature to summarize risk concisely. We apply our method to two real-world datasets and compare policies with different levels of risk-aversion using risk measures and recourse desiderata (sparsity and proximity).</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We explain how to use diffusion models to learn inverse renormalization group flows of statistical and quantum field theories. Diffusion models are a class of machine learning models which have been used to generate samples from complex distributions, such as the distribution of natural images, by learning the inverse process to a diffusion process which adds noise to the data until the distribution of the data is pure noise. Nonperturbative renormalization group schemes can naturally be written as diffusion processes in the space of fields. We combine these observations in a concrete framework for building ML-based models for studying field theories, in which the models learn the inverse process to an explicitly-specified renormalization group scheme. We detail how these models define a class of adaptive bridge (or parallel tempering) samplers for lattice field theory. Because renormalization group schemes have a physical meaning, we provide explicit prescriptions for how to compare results derived from models associated to several different renormalization group schemes of interest. We also explain how to use diffusion models in a variational method to find ground states of quantum systems. We apply some of our methods to numerically find RG flows of interacting statistical field theories. From the perspective of machine learning, our work provides an interpretation of multiscale diffusion models, and gives physically-inspired suggestions for diffusion models which should have novel properties.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Machine learning-based unfolding has enabled unbinned and high-dimensional differential cross section measurements. Two main approaches have emerged in this research area: one based on discriminative models and one based on generative models. The main advantage of discriminative models is that they learn a small correction to a starting simulation while generative models scale better to regions of phase space with little data. We propose to use Schroedinger Bridges and diffusion models to create SBUnfold, an unfolding approach that combines the strengths of both discriminative and generative models. The key feature of SBUnfold is that its generative model maps one set of events into another without having to go through a known probability density as is the case for normalizing flows and standard diffusion models. We show that SBUnfold achieves excellent performance compared to state of the art methods on a synthetic Z+jets dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Over recent years, an increasing amount of compute and data has been poured into training large language models (LLMs), usually by doing one-pass learning on as many tokens as possible randomly selected from large-scale web corpora. While training on ever-larger portions of the internet leads to consistent performance improvements, the size of these improvements diminishes with scale, and there has been little work exploring the effect of data selection on pre-training and downstream performance beyond simple de-duplication methods such as MinHash. Here, we show that careful data selection (on top of de-duplicated data) via pre-trained model embeddings can speed up training (20% efficiency gains) and improves average downstream accuracy on 16 NLP tasks (up to 2%) at the 6.7B model scale. Furthermore, we show that repeating data intelligently consistently outperforms baseline training (while repeating random data performs worse than baseline training). Our results indicate that clever data selection can significantly improve LLM pre-training, calls into question the common practice of training for a single epoch on as much data as possible, and demonstrates a path to keep improving our models past the limits of randomly sampling web data.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This research enhances linear regression models by integrating a Kalman filter and analysing curve areas to minimize loss. The goal is to develop an optimal linear regression equation using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for weight updating. Our approach involves a stepwise process, starting with user-defined parameters. The linear regression model is trained using SGD, tracking weights and loss separately and zipping them finally. A Kalman filter is then trained based on weight and loss arrays to predict the next consolidated weights. Predictions result from multiplying input averages with weights, evaluated for loss to form a weight-versus-loss curve. The curve’s equation is derived using the two-point formula, and area under the curve is calculated via integration. The linear regression equation with minimum area becomes the optimal curve for prediction. Benefits include avoiding constant weight updates via gradient descent and working with partial datasets, unlike methods needing the entire set. However, computational complexity should be considered. The Kalman filter’s accuracy might diminish beyond a certain prediction range.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This work provides a computable, direct, and mathematically rigorous approximation to the differential geometry of class manifolds for high-dimensional data, along with nonlinear projections from input space onto these class manifolds. The tools are applied to the setting of neural network image classifiers, where we generate novel, on-manifold data samples, and implement a projected gradient descent algorithm for on-manifold adversarial training. The susceptibility of neural networks (NNs) to adversarial attack highlights the brittle nature of NN decision boundaries in input space. Introducing adversarial examples during training has been shown to reduce the susceptibility of NNs to adversarial attack; however, it has also been shown to reduce the accuracy of the classifier if the examples are not valid examples for that class. Realistic “on-manifold” examples have been previously generated from class manifolds in the latent of an autoencoder. Our work explores these phenomena in a geometric and computational setting that is much closer to the raw, high-dimensional input space than can be provided by VAE or other black box dimensionality reductions. We employ conformally invariant diffusion maps (CIDM) to approximate class manifolds in diffusion coordinates, and develop the Nystr&quot;{o}m projection to project novel points onto class manifolds in this setting. On top of the manifold approximation, we leverage the spectral exterior calculus (SEC) to determine geometric quantities such as tangent vectors of the manifold. We use these tools to obtain adversarial examples that reside on a class manifold, yet fool a classifier. These misclassifications then become explainable in terms of human-understandable manipulations within the data, by expressing the on-manifold adversary in the semantic basis on the manifold.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Audio classification aims at recognizing audio signals, including speech commands or sound events. However, current audio classifiers are susceptible to perturbations and adversarial attacks. In addition, real-world audio classification tasks often suffer from limited labeled data. To help bridge these gaps, previous work developed neuro-inspired convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with sparse coding via the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) in the first layer (i.e., LCANets) for computer vision. LCANets learn in a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning, reducing dependency on labeled samples. Motivated by the fact that auditory cortex is also sparse, we extend LCANets to audio recognition tasks and introduce LCANets++, which are CNNs that perform sparse coding in multiple layers via LCA. We demonstrate that LCANets++ are more robust than standard CNNs and LCANets against perturbations, e.g., background noise, as well as black-box and white-box attacks, e.g., evasion and fast gradient sign (FGSM) attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Using learned reward functions (LRFs) as a means to solve sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) tasks has yielded some steady progress in task-complexity through the years. In this work, we question whether today’s LRFs are best-suited as a direct replacement for task rewards. Instead, we propose leveraging the capabilities of LRFs as a pretraining signal for RL. Concretely, we propose $\textbf{LA}$nguage Reward $\textbf{M}$odulated $\textbf{P}$retraining (LAMP) which leverages the zero-shot capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as a $\textit{pretraining}$ utility for RL as opposed to a downstream task reward. LAMP uses a frozen, pretrained VLM to scalably generate noisy, albeit shaped exploration rewards by computing the contrastive alignment between a highly diverse collection of language instructions and the image observations of an agent in its pretraining environment. LAMP optimizes these rewards in conjunction with standard novelty-seeking exploration rewards with reinforcement learning to acquire a language-conditioned, pretrained policy. Our VLM pretraining approach, which is a departure from previous attempts to use LRFs, can warmstart sample-efficient learning on robot manipulation tasks in RLBench.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>With the increasing usage, scale, and complexity of Deep Learning (DL) models, their rapidly growing energy consumption has become a critical concern. Promoting green development and energy awareness at different granularities is the need of the hour to limit carbon emissions of DL systems. However, the lack of standard and repeatable tools to accurately measure and optimize energy consumption at a fine granularity (e.g., at method level) hinders progress in this area. In this paper, we introduce FECoM (Fine-grained Energy Consumption Meter), a framework for fine-grained DL energy consumption measurement. Specifically, FECoM provides researchers and developers a mechanism to profile DL APIs. FECoM addresses the challenges of measuring energy consumption at fine-grained level by using static instrumentation and considering various factors, including computational load and temperature stability. We assess FECoM’s capability to measure fine-grained energy consumption for one of the most popular open-source DL frameworks, namely TensorFlow. Using FECoM, we also investigate the impact of parameter size and execution time on energy consumption, enriching our understanding of TensorFlow APIs’ energy profiles. Furthermore, we elaborate on the considerations, issues, and challenges that one needs to consider while designing and implementing a fine-grained energy consumption measurement tool. We hope this work will facilitate further advances in DL energy measurement and the development of energy-aware practices for DL systems.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Sequential recommenders have been widely used in industry due to their strength in modeling user preferences. While these models excel at learning a user’s positive interests, less attention has been paid to learning from negative user feedback. Negative user feedback is an important lever of user control, and comes with an expectation that recommenders should respond quickly and reduce similar recommendations to the user. However, negative feedback signals are often ignored in the training objective of sequential retrieval models, which primarily aim at predicting positive user interactions. In this work, we incorporate explicit and implicit negative user feedback into the training objective of sequential recommenders in the retrieval stage using a “not-to-recommend” loss function that optimizes for the log-likelihood of not recommending items with negative feedback. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using live experiments on a large-scale industrial recommender system. Furthermore, we address a challenge in measuring recommender responsiveness to negative feedback by developing a counterfactual simulation framework to compare recommender responses between different user actions, showing improved responsiveness from the modeling change.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>End-to-end learning has emerged as a major paradigm for developing autonomous systems. Unfortunately, with its performance and convenience comes an even greater challenge of safety assurance. A key factor of this challenge is the absence of the notion of a low-dimensional and interpretable dynamical state, around which traditional assurance methods revolve. Focusing on the online safety prediction problem, this paper proposes a configurable family of learning pipelines based on generative world models, which do not require low-dimensional states. To implement these pipelines, we overcome the challenges of learning safety-informed latent representations and missing safety labels under prediction-induced distribution shift. These pipelines come with statistical calibration guarantees on their safety chance predictions based on conformal prediction. We perform an extensive evaluation of the proposed learning pipelines on two case studies of image-controlled systems: a racing car and a cartpole.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Large language models (LLMs) and generative AI have played a transformative role in computer research and applications. Controversy has arisen as to whether these models output copyrighted data, which can occur if the data the models are trained on is copyrighted. LLMs are built on the transformer neural network architecture, which in turn relies on a mathematical computation called Attention that uses the softmax function.   In this paper, we show that large language model training and optimization can be seen as a softmax regression problem. We then establish a method of efficiently performing softmax regression, in a way that prevents the regression function from generating copyright data. This establishes a theoretical method of training large language models in a way that avoids generating copyright data.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Different conflicting optimization criteria arise naturally in various Deep Learning scenarios. These can address different main tasks (i.e., in the setting of Multi-Task Learning), but also main and secondary tasks such as loss minimization versus sparsity. The usual approach is a simple weighting of the criteria, which formally only works in the convex setting. In this paper, we present a Multi-Objective Optimization algorithm using a modified Weighted Chebyshev scalarization for training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with respect to several tasks. By employing this scalarization technique, the algorithm can identify all optimal solutions of the original problem while reducing its complexity to a sequence of single-objective problems. The simplified problems are then solved using an Augmented Lagrangian method, enabling the use of popular optimization techniques such as Adam and Stochastic Gradient Descent, while efficaciously handling constraints. Our work aims to address the (economical and also ecological) sustainability issue of DNN models, with a particular focus on Deep Multi-Task models, which are typically designed with a very large number of weights to perform equally well on multiple tasks. Through experiments conducted on two Machine Learning datasets, we demonstrate the possibility of adaptively sparsifying the model during training without significantly impacting its performance, if we are willing to apply task-specific adaptations to the network weights.

<p>Abstract:<br>Critical learning periods are periods early in development where temporary sensory deficits can have a permanent effect on behavior and learned representations. Despite the radical differences between biological and artificial networks, critical learning periods have been empirically observed in both systems. This suggests that critical periods may be fundamental to learning and not an accident of biology. Yet, why exactly critical periods emerge in deep networks is still an open question, and in particular it is unclear whether the critical periods observed in both systems depend on particular architectural or optimization details. To isolate the key underlying factors, we focus on deep linear network models, and show that, surprisingly, such networks also display much of the behavior seen in biology and artificial networks, while being amenable to analytical treatment. We show that critical periods depend on the depth of the model and structure of the data distribution. We also show analytically and in simulations that the learning of features is tied to competition between sources. Finally, we extend our analysis to multi-task learning to show that pre-training on certain tasks can damage the transfer performance on new tasks, and show how this depends on the relationship between tasks and the duration of the pre-training stage. To the best of our knowledge, our work provides the first analytically tractable model that sheds light into why critical learning periods emerge in biological and artificial networks.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The recent surge of generative AI has been fueled by the generative power of diffusion probabilistic models and the scalable capabilities of large language models. Despite their potential, it remains elusive whether diffusion language models can solve general language tasks comparable to their autoregressive counterparts. This paper demonstrates that scaling diffusion models w.r.t. data, sizes, and tasks can effectively make them strong language learners. We build competent diffusion language models at scale by first acquiring knowledge from massive data via masked language modeling pretraining thanks to their intrinsic connections. We then reprogram pretrained masked language models into diffusion language models via diffusive adaptation, wherein task-specific finetuning and instruction finetuning are explored to unlock their versatility in solving general language tasks. Experiments show that scaling diffusion language models consistently improves performance across downstream language tasks. We further discover that instruction finetuning can elicit zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning abilities that help tackle many unseen tasks by following natural language instructions, and show promise in advanced and challenging abilities such as reasoning</p>
