<p>Abstract:<br>LiDAR-based place recognition plays a crucial role in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and LiDAR localization.   Despite the emergence of various deep learning-based and hand-crafting-based methods, rotation-induced place recognition failure remains a critical challenge.   Existing studies address this limitation through specific training strategies or network structures.   However, the former does not produce satisfactory results, while the latter focuses mainly on the reduced problem of SO(2) rotation invariance. Methods targeting SO(3) rotation invariance suffer from limitations in discrimination capability.   In this paper, we propose a new method that employs Vector Neurons Network (VNN) to achieve SO(3) rotation invariance.   We first extract rotation-equivariant features from neighboring points and map low-dimensional features to a high-dimensional space through VNN.   Afterwards, we calculate the Euclidean and Cosine distance in the rotation-equivariant feature space as rotation-invariant feature descriptors.   Finally, we aggregate the features using GeM pooling to obtain global descriptors.   To address the significant information loss when formulating rotation-invariant descriptors, we propose computing distances between features at different layers within the Euclidean space neighborhood.   This greatly improves the discriminability of the point cloud descriptors while ensuring computational efficiency.   Experimental results on public datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms other baseline methods implementing rotation invariance, while achieving comparable results with current state-of-the-art place recognition methods that do not consider rotation issues.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We target cross-domain face reenactment in this paper, i.e., driving a cartoon image with the video of a real person and vice versa. Recently, many works have focused on one-shot talking face generation to drive a portrait with a real video, i.e., within-domain reenactment. Straightforwardly applying those methods to cross-domain animation will cause inaccurate expression transfer, blur effects, and even apparent artifacts due to the domain shift between cartoon and real faces. Only a few works attempt to settle cross-domain face reenactment. The most related work AnimeCeleb requires constructing a dataset with pose vector and cartoon image pairs by animating 3D characters, which makes it inapplicable anymore if no paired data is available. In this paper, we propose a novel method for cross-domain reenactment without paired data. Specifically, we propose a transformer-based framework to align the motions from different domains into a common latent space where motion transfer is conducted via latent code addition. Two domain-specific motion encoders and two learnable motion base memories are used to capture domain properties. A source query transformer and a driving one are exploited to project domain-specific motion to the canonical space. The edited motion is projected back to the domain of the source with a transformer. Moreover, since no paired data is provided, we propose a novel cross-domain training scheme using data from two domains with the designed analogy constraint. Besides, we contribute a cartoon dataset in Disney style. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our method over competing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Multi-modal fusion is increasingly being used for autonomous driving tasks, as images from different modalities provide unique information for feature extraction. However, the existing two-stream networks are only fused at a specific network layer, which requires a lot of manual attempts to set up. As the CNN goes deeper, the two modal features become more and more advanced and abstract, and the fusion occurs at the feature level with a large gap, which can easily hurt the performance. In this study, we propose a novel fusion architecture called skip-cross networks (SkipcrossNets), which combines adaptively LiDAR point clouds and camera images without being bound to a certain fusion epoch. Specifically, skip-cross connects each layer to each layer in a feed-forward manner, and for each layer, the feature maps of all previous layers are used as input and its own feature maps are used as input to all subsequent layers for the other modality, enhancing feature propagation and multi-modal features fusion. This strategy facilitates selection of the most similar feature layers from two data pipelines, providing a complementary effect for sparse point cloud features during fusion processes. The network is also divided into several blocks to reduce the complexity of feature fusion and the number of model parameters. The advantages of skip-cross fusion were demonstrated through application to the KITTI and A2D2 datasets, achieving a MaxF score of 96.85% on KITTI and an F1 score of 84.84% on A2D2. The model parameters required only 2.33 MB of memory at a speed of 68.24 FPS, which could be viable for mobile terminals and embedded devices.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is an imaging modality for visualising blood vessels. It is useful for several diagnostic applications and for assessing the risk of adverse events such as haemorrhagic stroke (resulting from the rupture of aneurysms in blood vessels). However, MRAs are not acquired routinely, hence, an approach to synthesise blood vessel segmentations from more routinely acquired MR contrasts such as T1 and T2, would be useful. We present an encoder-decoder model for synthesising segmentations of the main cerebral arteries in the circle of Willis (CoW) from only T2 MRI. We propose a two-phase multi-objective learning approach, which captures both global and local features. It uses learned local attention maps generated by dilating the segmentation labels, which forces the network to only extract information from the T2 MRI relevant to synthesising the CoW. Our synthetic vessel segmentations generated from only T2 MRI achieved a mean Dice score of $0.79 \pm 0.03$ in testing, compared to state-of-the-art segmentation networks such as transformer U-Net ($0.71 \pm 0.04$) and nnU-net($0.68 \pm 0.05$), while using only a fraction of the parameters. The main qualitative difference between our synthetic vessel segmentations and the comparative models was in the sharper resolution of the CoW vessel segments, especially in the posterior circulation.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Robust obstacle avoidance is one of the critical steps for successful goal-driven indoor navigation tasks.Due to the obstacle missing in the visual image and the possible missed detection issue, visual image-based obstacle avoidance techniques still suffer from unsatisfactory robustness. To mitigate it, in this paper, we propose a novel implicit obstacle map-driven indoor navigation framework for robust obstacle avoidance, where an implicit obstacle map is learned based on the historical trial-and-error experience rather than the visual image. In order to further improve the navigation efficiency, a non-local target memory aggregation module is designed to leverage a non-local network to model the intrinsic relationship between the target semantic and the target orientation clues during the navigation process so as to mine the most target-correlated object clues for the navigation decision. Extensive experimental results on AI2-Thor and RoboTHOR benchmarks verify the excellent obstacle avoidance and navigation efficiency of our proposed method.

<p>Abstract:<br>Through our respiratory system, many viruses and diseases frequently spread and pass from one person to another. Covid-19 served as an example of how crucial it is to track down and cut back on contacts to stop its spread. There is a clear gap in finding automatic methods that can detect hand-to-face contact in complex urban scenes or indoors. In this paper, we introduce a computer vision framework, called FaceTouch, based on deep learning. It comprises deep sub-models to detect humans and analyse their actions. FaceTouch seeks to detect hand-to-face touches in the wild, such as through video chats, bus footage, or CCTV feeds. Despite partial occlusion of faces, the introduced system learns to detect face touches from the RGB representation of a given scene by utilising the representation of the body gestures such as arm movement. This has been demonstrated to be useful in complex urban scenarios beyond simply identifying hand movement and its closeness to faces. Relying on Supervised Contrastive Learning, the introduced model is trained on our collected dataset, given the absence of other benchmark datasets. The framework shows a strong validation in unseen datasets which opens the door for potential deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The portrait matting task aims to extract an alpha matte with complete semantics and finely-detailed contours. In comparison to CNN-based approaches, transformers with self-attention allow a larger receptive field, enabling it to better capture long-range dependencies and low-frequency semantic information of a portrait. However, the recent research shows that self-attention mechanism struggle with modeling high-frequency information and capturing fine contour details, which can lead to bias while predicting the portrait’s contours. To address the problem, we propose EFormer to enhance the model’s attention towards semantic and contour features. Especially the latter, which is surrounded by a large amount of high-frequency details. We build a semantic and contour detector (SCD) to accurately capture the distribution of semantic and contour features. And we further design contour-edge extraction branch and semantic extraction branch for refining contour features and complete semantic information. Finally, we fuse the two kinds of features and leverage the segmentation head to generate the predicted portrait matte. Remarkably, EFormer is an end-to-end trimap-free method and boasts a simple structure. Experiments conducted on VideoMatte240K-JPEGSD and AIM datasets demonstrate that EFormer outperforms previous portrait matte methods.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Surgical context inference has recently garnered significant attention in robot-assisted surgery as it can facilitate workflow analysis, skill assessment, and error detection. However, runtime context inference is challenging since it requires timely and accurate detection of the interactions among the tools and objects in the surgical scene based on the segmentation of video data. On the other hand, existing state-of-the-art video segmentation methods are often biased against infrequent classes and fail to provide temporal consistency for segmented masks. This can negatively impact the context inference and accurate detection of critical states. In this study, we propose a solution to these challenges using a Space Time Correspondence Network (STCN). STCN is a memory network that performs binary segmentation and minimizes the effects of class imbalance. The use of a memory bank in STCN allows for the utilization of past image and segmentation information, thereby ensuring consistency of the masks. Our experiments using the publicly available JIGSAWS dataset demonstrate that STCN achieves superior segmentation performance for objects that are difficult to segment, such as needle and thread, and improves context inference compared to the state-of-the-art. We also demonstrate that segmentation and context inference can be performed at runtime without compromising performance.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Prior work in 3D object detection evaluates models using offline metrics like average precision since closed-loop online evaluation on the downstream driving task is costly. However, it is unclear how indicative offline results are of driving performance. In this work, we perform the first empirical evaluation measuring how predictive different detection metrics are of driving performance when detectors are integrated into a full self-driving stack. We conduct extensive experiments on urban driving in the CARLA simulator using 16 object detection models. We find that the nuScenes Detection Score has a higher correlation to driving performance than the widely used average precision metric. In addition, our results call for caution on the exclusive reliance on the emerging class of &#96;planner-centric’ metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The diversity in length constitutes a significant characteristic of text. Due to the long-tail distribution of text lengths, most existing methods for scene text recognition (STR) only work well on short or seen-length text, lacking the capability of recognizing longer text or performing length extrapolation. This is a crucial issue, since the lengths of the text to be recognized are usually not given in advance in real-world applications, but it has not been adequately investigated in previous works. Therefore, we propose in this paper a method called Length-Insensitive Scene TExt Recognizer (LISTER), which remedies the limitation regarding the robustness to various text lengths. Specifically, a Neighbor Decoder is proposed to obtain accurate character attention maps with the assistance of a novel neighbor matrix regardless of the text lengths. Besides, a Feature Enhancement Module is devised to model the long-range dependency with low computation cost, which is able to perform iterations with the neighbor decoder to enhance the feature map progressively. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to achieve effective length-insensitive scene text recognition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed LISTER algorithm exhibits obvious superiority on long text recognition and the ability for length extrapolation, while comparing favourably with the previous state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks for STR (mainly short text).</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>CNNs have been widely applied for medical image analysis. However, limited memory capacity is one of the most common drawbacks of processing high-resolution 3D volumetric data. 3D volumes are usually cropped or downsized first before processing, which can result in a loss of resolution, increase class imbalance, and affect the performance of the segmentation algorithms. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning approach called IP-UNet. IP-UNet is a UNet-based model that performs multi-class segmentation on Intensity Projection (IP) of 3D volumetric data instead of the memory-consuming 3D volumes. IP-UNet uses limited memory capability for training without losing the original 3D image resolution. We compare the performance of three models in terms of segmentation accuracy and computational cost: 1) Slice-by-slice 2D segmentation of the CT scan images using a conventional 2D UNet model. 2) IP-UNet that operates on data obtained by merging the extracted Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP), Closest Vessel Projection (CVP), and Average Intensity Projection (AvgIP) representations of the source 3D volumes, then applying the UNet model on the output IP images. 3) 3D-UNet model directly reads the 3D volumes constructed from a series of CT scan images and outputs the 3D volume of the predicted segmentation. We test the performance of these methods on 3D volumetric images for automatic breast calcification detection. Experimental results show that IP-Unet can achieve similar segmentation accuracy with 3D-Unet but with much better performance. It reduces the training time by 70% and memory consumption by 92%.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In this work, we address the task of few-shot part segmentation, which aims to segment the different parts of an unseen object using very few labeled examples. It is found that leveraging the textual space of a powerful pre-trained image-language model (such as CLIP) can be beneficial in learning visual features. Therefore, we develop a novel method termed PartSeg for few-shot part segmentation based on multimodal learning. Specifically, we design a part-aware prompt learning method to generate part-specific prompts that enable the CLIP model to better understand the concept of &#96;&#96;part’’ and fully utilize its textual space. Furthermore, since the concept of the same part under different object categories is general, we establish relationships between these parts during the prompt learning process. We conduct extensive experiments on the PartImageNet and Pascal$_$Part datasets, and the experimental results demonstrated that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Underwater object detection suffers from low detection performance because the distance and wavelength dependent imaging process yield evident image quality degradations such as haze-like effects, low visibility, and color distortions. Therefore, we commit to resolving the issue of underwater object detection with compounded environmental degradations. Typical approaches attempt to develop sophisticated deep architecture to generate high-quality images or features. However, these methods are only work for limited ranges because imaging factors are either unstable, too sensitive, or compounded. Unlike these approaches catering for high-quality images or features, this paper seeks transferable prior knowledge from detector-friendly images. The prior guides detectors removing degradations that interfere with detection. It is based on statistical observations that, the heavily degraded regions of detector-friendly (DFUI) and underwater images have evident feature distribution gaps while the lightly degraded regions of them overlap each other. Therefore, we propose a residual feature transference module (RFTM) to learn a mapping between deep representations of the heavily degraded patches of DFUI- and underwater- images, and make the mapping as a heavily degraded prior (HDP) for underwater detection. Since the statistical properties are independent to image content, HDP can be learned without the supervision of semantic labels and plugged into popular CNNbased feature extraction networks to improve their performance on underwater object detection. Without bells and whistles, evaluations on URPC2020 and UODD show that our methods outperform CNN-based detectors by a large margin. Our method with higher speeds and less parameters still performs better than transformer-based detectors.

<p>Abstract:<br>Convolutional neural networks excel in histopathological image classification, yet their pixel-level focus hampers explainability. Conversely, emerging graph convolutional networks spotlight cell-level features and medical implications. However, limited by their shallowness and suboptimal use of high-dimensional pixel data, GCNs underperform in multi-class histopathological image classification. To make full use of pixel-level and cell-level features dynamically, we propose an asymmetric co-training framework combining a deep graph convolutional network and a convolutional neural network for multi-class histopathological image classification. To improve the explainability of the entire framework by embedding morphological and topological distribution of cells, we build a 14-layer deep graph convolutional network to handle cell graph data. For the further utilization and dynamic interactions between pixel-level and cell-level information, we also design a co-training strategy to integrate the two asymmetric branches. Notably, we collect a private clinically acquired dataset termed LUAD7C, including seven subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma, which is rare and more challenging. We evaluated our approach on the private LUAD7C and public colorectal cancer datasets, showcasing its superior performance, explainability, and generalizability in multi-class histopathological image classification.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The hypothalamus plays a crucial role in the regulation of a broad range of physiological, behavioural, and cognitive functions. However, despite its importance, only a few small-scale neuroimaging studies have investigated its substructures, likely due to the lack of fully automated segmentation tools to address scalability and reproducibility issues of manual segmentation. While the only previous attempt to automatically sub-segment the hypothalamus with a neural network showed promise for 1.0 mm isotropic T1-weighted (T1w) MRI, there is a need for an automated tool to sub-segment also high-resolutional (HiRes) MR scans, as they are becoming widely available, and include structural detail also from multi-modal MRI. We, therefore, introduce a novel, fast, and fully automated deep learning method named HypVINN for sub-segmentation of the hypothalamus and adjacent structures on 0.8 mm isotropic T1w and T2w brain MR images that is robust to missing modalities. We extensively validate our model with respect to segmentation accuracy, generalizability, in-session test-retest reliability, and sensitivity to replicate hypothalamic volume effects (e.g. sex-differences). The proposed method exhibits high segmentation performance both for standalone T1w images as well as for T1w&#x2F;T2w image pairs. Even with the additional capability to accept flexible inputs, our model matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods with fixed inputs. We, further, demonstrate the generalizability of our method in experiments with 1.0 mm MR scans from both the Rhineland Study and the UK Biobank. Finally, HypVINN can perform the segmentation in less than a minute (GPU) and will be available in the open source FastSurfer neuroimaging software suite, offering a validated, efficient, and scalable solution for evaluating imaging-derived phenotypes of the hypothalamus.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In recent years, computer-aided diagnosis systems have shown great potential in assisting radiologists with accurate and efficient medical image analysis. This paper presents a novel approach for bone pathology localization and classification in wrist X-ray images using a combination of YOLO (You Only Look Once) and the Shifted Window Transformer (Swin) with a newly proposed block. The proposed methodology addresses two critical challenges in wrist X-ray analysis: accurate localization of bone pathologies and precise classification of abnormalities. The YOLO framework is employed to detect and localize bone pathologies, leveraging its real-time object detection capabilities. Additionally, the Swin, a transformer-based module, is utilized to extract contextual information from the localized regions of interest (ROIs) for accurate classification.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The integration of visual encoders and large language models (LLMs) has driven recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, the scarcity of high-quality instruction-tuning data for vision-language tasks remains a challenge. The current leading paradigm, such as LLaVA, relies on language-only GPT-4 to generate data, which requires pre-annotated image captions and detection bounding boxes, suffering from understanding image details. A practical solution to this problem would be to utilize the available multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate instruction data for vision-language tasks. However, it’s worth noting that the currently accessible MLLMs are not as powerful as their LLM counterparts, as they tend to produce inadequate responses and generate false information. As a solution for addressing the current issue, this paper proposes the Visual Instruction Generation and Correction (VIGC) framework that enables multimodal large language models to generate instruction-tuning data and progressively enhance its quality on-the-fly. Specifically, Visual Instruction Generation (VIG) guides the vision-language model to generate diverse instruction-tuning data. To ensure generation quality, Visual Instruction Correction (VIC) adopts an iterative update mechanism to correct any inaccuracies in data produced by VIG, effectively reducing the risk of hallucination. Leveraging the diverse, high-quality data generated by VIGC, we finetune mainstream models and validate data quality based on various evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that VIGC not only compensates for the shortcomings of language-only data generation methods, but also effectively enhances the benchmark performance. The models, datasets, and code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In this work, we construct a large-scale dataset for Ground-to-Aerial Person Search, named G2APS, which contains 31,770 images of 260,559 annotated bounding boxes for 2,644 identities appearing in both of the UAVs and ground surveillance cameras. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset for cross-platform intelligent surveillance applications, where the UAVs could work as a powerful complement for the ground surveillance cameras. To more realistically simulate the actual cross-platform Ground-to-Aerial surveillance scenarios, the surveillance cameras are fixed about 2 meters above the ground, while the UAVs capture videos of persons at different location, with a variety of view-angles, flight attitudes and flight modes. Therefore, the dataset has the following unique characteristics: 1) drastic view-angle changes between query and gallery person images from cross-platform cameras; 2) diverse resolutions, poses and views of the person images under 9 rich real-world scenarios. On basis of the G2APS benchmark dataset, we demonstrate detailed analysis about current two-step and end-to-end person search methods, and further propose a simple yet effective knowledge distillation scheme on the head of the ReID network, which achieves state-of-the-art performances on both of the G2APS and the previous two public person search datasets, i.e., PRW and CUHK-SYSU.

<p>Abstract:<br>Creating layouts is a fundamental step in graphic design. In this work, we propose to use text as the guidance to create graphic layouts, i.e., Text-to-Layout, aiming to lower the design barriers. Text-to-Layout is a challenging task, because it needs to consider the implicit, combined, and incomplete layout constraints from text, each of which has not been studied in previous work. To address this, we present a two-stage approach, named parse-then-place. The approach introduces an intermediate representation (IR) between text and layout to represent diverse layout constraints. With IR, Text-to-Layout is decomposed into a parse stage and a place stage. The parse stage takes a textual description as input and generates an IR, in which the implicit constraints from the text are transformed into explicit ones. The place stage generates layouts based on the IR. To model combined and incomplete constraints, we use a Transformer-based layout generation model and carefully design a way to represent constraints and layouts as sequences. Besides, we adopt the pretrain-then-finetune strategy to boost the performance of the layout generation model with large-scale unlabeled layouts. To evaluate our approach, we construct two Text-to-Layout datasets and conduct experiments on them. Quantitative results, qualitative analysis, and user studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Accurate classification of white blood cells in peripheral blood is essential for diagnosing hematological diseases. Due to constantly evolving clinical settings, data sources, and disease classifications, it is necessary to update machine learning classification models regularly for practical real-world use. Such models significantly benefit from sequentially learning from incoming data streams without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. However, models can suffer from catastrophic forgetting, causing a drop in performance on previous tasks when fine-tuned on new data. Here, we propose a rehearsal-based continual learning approach for class incremental and domain incremental scenarios in white blood cell classification. To choose representative samples from previous tasks, we employ exemplar set selection based on the model’s predictions. This involves selecting the most confident samples and the most challenging samples identified through uncertainty estimation of the model. We thoroughly evaluated our proposed approach on three white blood cell classification datasets that differ in color, resolution, and class composition, including scenarios where new domains or new classes are introduced to the model with every task. We also test a long class incremental experiment with both new domains and new classes. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms established baselines in continual learning, including existing iCaRL and EWC methods for classifying white blood cells in cross-domain environments.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Accurate classification of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) subtypes is crucial for clinical decision-making and patient care. In this study, we investigate the potential presence of age and sex bias in AML subtype classification using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) architectures. To that end, we train multiple MIL models using different levels of sex imbalance in the training set and excluding certain age groups. To assess the sex bias, we evaluate the performance of the models on male and female test sets. For age bias, models are tested against underrepresented age groups in the training data. We find a significant effect of sex and age bias on the performance of the model for AML subtype classification. Specifically, we observe that females are more likely to be affected by sex imbalance dataset and certain age groups, such as patients with 72 to 86 years of age with the RUNX1::RUNX1T1 genetic subtype, are significantly affected by an age bias present in the training data. Ensuring inclusivity in the training data is thus essential for generating reliable and equitable outcomes in AML genetic subtype classification, ultimately benefiting diverse patient populations.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In this paper, we introduce Masked Feature Modelling (MFM), a novel approach for the unsupervised pre-training of a Graph Attention Network (GAT) block. MFM utilizes a pretrained Visual Tokenizer to reconstruct masked features of objects within a video, leveraging the MiniKinetics dataset. We then incorporate the pre-trained GAT block into a state-of-the-art bottom-up supervised video-event recognition architecture, ViGAT, to improve the model’s starting point and overall accuracy. Experimental evaluations on the YLI-MED dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of MFM in improving event recognition performance.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Assessing the robustness of deep neural networks against out-of-distribution inputs is crucial, especially in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving, but also in safety systems where malicious actors can digitally alter inputs to circumvent safety guards. However, designing effective out-of-distribution tests that encompass all possible scenarios while preserving accurate label information is a challenging task. Existing methodologies often entail a compromise between variety and constraint levels for attacks and sometimes even both. In a first step towards a more holistic robustness evaluation of image classification models, we introduce an attack method based on image solarization that is conceptually straightforward yet avoids jeopardizing the global structure of natural images independent of the intensity. Through comprehensive evaluations of multiple ImageNet models, we demonstrate the attack’s capacity to degrade accuracy significantly, provided it is not integrated into the training augmentations. Interestingly, even then, no full immunity to accuracy deterioration is achieved. In other settings, the attack can often be simplified into a black-box attack with model-independent parameters. Defenses against other corruptions do not consistently extend to be effective against our specific attack.

<p>Abstract:<br>The CoachAI Badminton 2023 Track1 initiative aim to automatically detect events within badminton match videos. Detecting small objects, especially the shuttlecock, is of quite importance and demands high precision within the challenge. Such detection is crucial for tasks like hit count, hitting time, and hitting location. However, even after revising the well-regarded shuttlecock detecting model, TrackNet, our object detection models still fall short of the desired accuracy. To address this issue, we’ve implemented various deep learning methods to tackle the problems arising from noisy detectied data, leveraging diverse data types to improve precision. In this report, we detail the detection model modifications we’ve made and our approach to the 11 tasks. Notably, our system garnered a score of 0.78 out of 1.0 in the challenge.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Currently, digital avatars can be created manually using human images as reference. Systems such as Bitmoji are excellent producers of detailed avatar designs, with hundreds of choices for customization. A supervised learning model could be trained to generate avatars automatically, but the hundreds of possible options create difficulty in securing non-noisy data to train a model. As a solution, we train a model to produce avatars from human images using tag-based annotations. This method provides better annotator agreement, leading to less noisy data and higher quality model predictions. Our contribution is an application of tag-based annotation to train a model for avatar face creation. We design tags for 3 different facial facial features offered by Bitmoji, and train a model using tag-based annotation to predict the nose.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The classification of gigapixel histopathology images with deep multiple instance learning models has become a critical task in digital pathology and precision medicine. In this work, we propose a Transformer-based multiple instance learning approach that replaces the traditional learned attention mechanism with a regional, Vision Transformer inspired self-attention mechanism. We present a method that fuses regional patch information to derive slide-level predictions and show how this regional aggregation can be stacked to hierarchically process features on different distance levels. To increase predictive accuracy, especially for datasets with small, local morphological features, we introduce a method to focus the image processing on high attention regions during inference. Our approach is able to significantly improve performance over the baseline on two histopathology datasets and points towards promising directions for further research.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Weakly supervised temporal action localization (WSTAL) aims to localize actions in untrimmed videos using video-level labels. Despite recent advances, existing approaches mainly follow a localization-by-classification pipeline, generally processing each segment individually, thereby exploiting only limited contextual information. As a result, the model will lack a comprehensive understanding (e.g. appearance and temporal structure) of various action patterns, leading to ambiguity in classification learning and temporal localization. Our work addresses this from a novel perspective, by exploring and exploiting the cross-video contextual knowledge within the dataset to recover the dataset-level semantic structure of action instances via weak labels only, thereby indirectly improving the holistic understanding of fine-grained action patterns and alleviating the aforementioned ambiguities. Specifically, an end-to-end framework is proposed, including a Robust Memory-Guided Contrastive Learning (RMGCL) module and a Global Knowledge Summarization and Aggregation (GKSA) module. First, the RMGCL module explores the contrast and consistency of cross-video action features, assisting in learning more structured and compact embedding space, thus reducing ambiguity in classification learning. Further, the GKSA module is used to efficiently summarize and propagate the cross-video representative action knowledge in a learnable manner to promote holistic action patterns understanding, which in turn allows the generation of high-confidence pseudo-labels for self-learning, thus alleviating ambiguity in temporal localization. Extensive experiments on THUMOS14, ActivityNet1.3, and FineAction demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and can be easily plugged into other WSTAL methods.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Point-supervised Temporal Action Localization (PSTAL) is an emerging research direction for label-efficient learning. However, current methods mainly focus on optimizing the network either at the snippet-level or the instance-level, neglecting the inherent reliability of point annotations at both levels. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Reliability Propagation (HR-Pro) framework, which consists of two reliability-aware stages: Snippet-level Discrimination Learning and Instance-level Completeness Learning, both stages explore the efficient propagation of high-confidence cues in point annotations. For snippet-level learning, we introduce an online-updated memory to store reliable snippet prototypes for each class. We then employ a Reliability-aware Attention Block to capture both intra-video and inter-video dependencies of snippets, resulting in more discriminative and robust snippet representation. For instance-level learning, we propose a point-based proposal generation approach as a means of connecting snippets and instances, which produces high-confidence proposals for further optimization at the instance level. Through multi-level reliability-aware learning, we obtain more reliable confidence scores and more accurate temporal boundaries of predicted proposals.

<p>Abstract:<br>Diffusion models have exhibited promising progress in video generation. However, they often struggle to retain consistent details within local regions across frames. One underlying cause is that traditional diffusion models approximate Gaussian noise distribution by utilizing predictive noise, without fully accounting for the impact of inherent information within the input itself. Additionally, these models emphasize the distinction between predictions and references, neglecting information intrinsic to the videos. To address this limitation, inspired by the self-attention mechanism, we propose a novel text-to-video (T2V) generation network structure based on diffusion models, dubbed Additional Perturbation for Latent noise with Adversarial training (APLA). Our approach only necessitates a single video as input and builds upon pre-trained stable diffusion networks. Notably, we introduce an additional compact network, known as the Video Generation Transformer (VGT). This auxiliary component is designed to extract perturbations from the inherent information contained within the input, thereby refining inconsistent pixels during temporal predictions. We leverage a hybrid architecture of transformers and convolutions to compensate for temporal intricacies, enhancing consistency between different frames within the video. Experiments demonstrate a noticeable improvement in the consistency of the generated videos both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Automatic medical report generation (MRG) is of great research value as it has the potential to relieve radiologists from the heavy burden of report writing. Despite recent advancements, accurate MRG remains challenging due to the need for precise clinical understanding and the identification of clinical findings. Moreover, the imbalanced distribution of diseases makes the challenge even more pronounced, as rare diseases are underrepresented in training data, making their diagnostic performance unreliable. To address these challenges, we propose diagnosis-driven prompts for medical report generation (PromptMRG), a novel framework that aims to improve the diagnostic accuracy of MRG with the guidance of diagnosis-aware prompts. Specifically, PromptMRG is based on encoder-decoder architecture with an extra disease classification branch. When generating reports, the diagnostic results from the classification branch are converted into token prompts to explicitly guide the generation process. To further improve the diagnostic accuracy, we design cross-modal feature enhancement, which retrieves similar reports from the database to assist the diagnosis of a query image by leveraging the knowledge from a pre-trained CLIP. Moreover, the disease imbalanced issue is addressed by applying an adaptive logit-adjusted loss to the classification branch based on the individual learning status of each disease, which overcomes the barrier of text decoder’s inability to manipulate disease distributions. Experiments on two MRG benchmarks show the effectiveness of the proposed method, where it obtains state-of-the-art clinical efficacy performance on both datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Pose based video sychronization can have applications in multiple domains such as gameplay performance evaluation, choreography or guiding athletes. The subject’s actions could be compared and evaluated against those performed by professionals side by side. In this paper, we propose an end to end pipeline for synchronizing videos based on pose. The first step crops the region where the person present in the image followed by pose detection on the cropped image. This is followed by application of Dynamic Time Warping(DTW) on angle&#x2F; distance measures between the pose keypoints leading to a scale and shift invariant pose matching pipeline.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recent advances in semi-supervised semantic segmentation have been heavily reliant on pseudo labeling to compensate for limited labeled data, disregarding the valuable relational knowledge among semantic concepts. To bridge this gap, we devise LogicDiag, a brand new neural-logic semi-supervised learning framework. Our key insight is that conflicts within pseudo labels, identified through symbolic knowledge, can serve as strong yet commonly ignored learning signals. LogicDiag resolves such conflicts via reasoning with logic-induced diagnoses, enabling the recovery of (potentially) erroneous pseudo labels, ultimately alleviating the notorious error accumulation problem. We showcase the practical application of LogicDiag in the data-hungry segmentation scenario, where we formalize the structured abstraction of semantic concepts as a set of logic rules. Extensive experiments on three standard semi-supervised semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of LogicDiag. Moreover, LogicDiag highlights the promising opportunities arising from the systematic integration of symbolic reasoning into the prevalent statistical, neural learning approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Learning 3D shape representation with dense correspondence for deformable objects is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Existing approaches often need additional annotations of specific semantic domain, e.g., skeleton poses for human bodies or animals, which require extra annotation effort and suffer from error accumulation, and they are limited to specific domain. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised approach to learn neural implicit shape representation for deformable objects, which can represent shapes with a template shape and dense correspondence in 3D. Our method does not require the priors of skeleton and skinning weight, and only requires a collection of shapes represented in signed distance fields. To handle the large deformation, we constrain the learned template shape in the same latent space with the training shapes, design a new formulation of local rigid constraint that enforces rigid transformation in local region and addresses local reflection issue, and present a new hierarchical rigid constraint to reduce the ambiguity due to the joint learning of template shape and correspondences. Extensive experiments show that our model can represent shapes with large deformations. We also show that our shape representation can support two typical applications, such as texture transfer and shape editing, with competitive performance.

<p>Abstract:<br>Cross-modal alignment is one key challenge for Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). Most existing studies concentrate on mapping the global instruction or single sub-instruction to the corresponding trajectory. However, another critical problem of achieving fine-grained alignment at the entity level is seldom considered. To address this problem, we propose a novel Grounded Entity-Landmark Adaptive (GELA) pre-training paradigm for VLN tasks. To achieve the adaptive pre-training paradigm, we first introduce grounded entity-landmark human annotations into the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset, named GEL-R2R. Additionally, we adopt three grounded entity-landmark adaptive pre-training objectives: 1) entity phrase prediction, 2) landmark bounding box prediction, and 3) entity-landmark semantic alignment, which explicitly supervise the learning of fine-grained cross-modal alignment between entity phrases and environment landmarks. Finally, we validate our model on two downstream benchmarks: VLN with descriptive instructions (R2R) and dialogue instructions (CVDN). The comprehensive experiments show that our GELA model achieves state-of-the-art results on both tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Handling entirely unknown data is a challenge for any deployed classifier. Classification models are typically trained on a static pre-defined dataset and are kept in the dark for the open unassigned feature space. As a result, they struggle to deal with out-of-distribution data during inference. Addressing this task on the class-level is termed open-set recognition (OSR). However, most OSR methods are inherently limited, as they train closed-set classifiers and only adapt the downstream predictions to OSR. This work presents LORD, a framework to Leverage Open-set Recognition by exploiting unknown Data. LORD explicitly models open space during classifier training and provides a systematic evaluation for such approaches. We identify three model-agnostic training strategies that exploit background data and applied them to well-established classifiers. Due to LORD’s extensive evaluation protocol, we consistently demonstrate improved recognition of unknown data. The benchmarks facilitate in-depth analysis across various requirement levels. To mitigate dependency on extensive and costly background datasets, we explore mixup as an off-the-shelf data generation technique. Our experiments highlight mixup’s effectiveness as a substitute for background datasets. Lightweight constraints on mixup synthesis further improve OSR performance.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Existing K-nearest neighbor (KNN) retrieval-based methods usually conduct industrial anomaly detection in two stages: obtain feature representations with a pre-trained CNN model and perform distance measures for defect detection. However, the features are not fully exploited as they ignore domain bias and the difference of local density in feature space, which limits the detection performance. In this paper, we propose Reducing Biases (REB) in representation by considering the domain bias of the pre-trained model and building a self-supervised learning task for better domain adaption with a defect generation strategy (DefectMaker) imitating the natural defects. Additionally, we propose a local density KNN (LDKNN) to reduce the local density bias and obtain effective anomaly detection. We achieve a promising result of 99.5% AUROC on the widely used MVTec AD benchmark. We also achieve 88.0% AUROC on the challenging MVTec LOCO AD dataset and bring an improvement of 4.7% AUROC to the state-of-the-art result. All results are obtained with smaller backbone networks such as Vgg11 and Resnet18, which indicates the effectiveness and efficiency of REB for practical industrial applications.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>High-Definition (HD) maps are essential for the safety of autonomous driving systems. While existing techniques employ camera images and onboard sensors to generate vectorized high-precision maps, they are constrained by their reliance on single-frame input. This approach limits their stability and performance in complex scenarios such as occlusions, largely due to the absence of temporal information. Moreover, their performance diminishes when applied to broader perception ranges. In this paper, we present StreamMapNet, a novel online mapping pipeline adept at long-sequence temporal modeling of videos. StreamMapNet employs multi-point attention and temporal information which empowers the construction of large-range local HD maps with high stability and further addresses the limitations of existing methods. Furthermore, we critically examine widely used online HD Map construction benchmark and datasets, Argoverse2 and nuScenes, revealing significant bias in the existing evaluation protocols. We propose to resplit the benchmarks according to geographical spans, promoting fair and precise evaluations. Experimental results validate that StreamMapNet significantly outperforms existing methods across all settings while maintaining an online inference speed of $14.2$ FPS.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Audio-visual zero-shot learning aims to classify samples consisting of a pair of corresponding audio and video sequences from classes that are not present during training. An analysis of the audio-visual data reveals a large degree of hyperbolicity, indicating the potential benefit of using a hyperbolic transformation to achieve curvature-aware geometric learning, with the aim of exploring more complex hierarchical data structures for this task. The proposed approach employs a novel loss function that incorporates cross-modality alignment between video and audio features in the hyperbolic space. Additionally, we explore the use of multiple adaptive curvatures for hyperbolic projections. The experimental results on this very challenging task demonstrate that our proposed hyperbolic approach for zero-shot learning outperforms the SOTA method on three datasets: VGGSound-GZSL, UCF-GZSL, and ActivityNet-GZSL achieving a harmonic mean (HM) improvement of around 3.0%, 7.0%, and 5.3%, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Siamese network has been a de facto benchmark framework for 3D LiDAR object tracking with a shared-parametric encoder extracting features from template and search region, respectively. This paradigm relies heavily on an additional matching network to model the cross-correlation&#x2F;similarity of the template and search region. In this paper, we forsake the conventional Siamese paradigm and propose a novel single-branch framework, SyncTrack, synchronizing the feature extracting and matching to avoid forwarding encoder twice for template and search region as well as introducing extra parameters of matching network. The synchronization mechanism is based on the dynamic affinity of the Transformer, and an in-depth analysis of the relevance is provided theoretically. Moreover, based on the synchronization, we introduce a novel Attentive Points-Sampling strategy into the Transformer layers (APST), replacing the random&#x2F;Farthest Points Sampling (FPS) method with sampling under the supervision of attentive relations between the template and search region. It implies connecting point-wise sampling with the feature learning, beneficial to aggregating more distinctive and geometric features for tracking with sparse points. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (KITTI and NuScenes) show that SyncTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-time tracking.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper focuses on the use of emotion recognition techniques to assist psychologists in performing children’s therapy through remotely robot operated sessions. In the field of psychology, the use of agent-mediated therapy is growing increasingly given recent advances in robotics and computer science. Specifically, the use of Embodied Conversational Agents (ECA) as an intermediary tool can help professionals connect with children who face social challenges such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or even who are physically unavailable due to being in regions of armed conflict, natural disasters, or other circumstances. In this context, emotion recognition represents an important feedback for the psychotherapist. In this article, we initially present the result of a bibliographical research associated with emotion recognition in children. This research revealed an initial overview on algorithms and datasets widely used by the community. Then, based on the analysis carried out on the results of the bibliographical research, we used the technique of dense optical flow features to improve the ability of identifying emotions in children in uncontrolled environments. From the output of a hybrid model of Convolutional Neural Network, two intermediary features are fused before being processed by a final classifier. The proposed architecture was called HybridCNNFusion. Finally, we present the initial results achieved in the recognition of children’s emotions using a dataset of Brazilian children.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Image fusion aims to generate a high-quality image from multiple images captured under varying conditions. The key problem of this task is to preserve complementary information while filtering out irrelevant information for the fused result. However, existing methods address this problem by leveraging static convolutional neural networks (CNNs), suffering two inherent limitations during feature extraction, i.e., being unable to handle spatial-variant contents and lacking guidance from multiple inputs. In this paper, we propose a novel mutual-guided dynamic network (MGDN) for image fusion, which allows for effective information utilization across different locations and inputs. Specifically, we design a mutual-guided dynamic filter (MGDF) for adaptive feature extraction, composed of a mutual-guided cross-attention (MGCA) module and a dynamic filter predictor, where the former incorporates additional guidance from different inputs and the latter generates spatial-variant kernels for different locations. In addition, we introduce a parallel feature fusion (PFF) module to effectively fuse local and global information of the extracted features. To further reduce the redundancy among the extracted features while simultaneously preserving their shared structural information, we devise a novel loss function that combines the minimization of normalized mutual information (NMI) with an estimated gradient mask. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods on four image fusion tasks.

<p>Abstract:<br>In recent years, the task of learned point cloud compression has gained prominence. An important type of point cloud, the spinning LiDAR point cloud, is generated by spinning LiDAR on vehicles. This process results in numerous circular shapes and azimuthal angle invariance features within the point clouds. However, these two features have been largely overlooked by previous methodologies. In this paper, we introduce a model-agnostic method called Spherical-Coordinate-based learned Point cloud compression (SCP), designed to leverage the aforementioned features fully. Additionally, we propose a multi-level Octree for SCP to mitigate the reconstruction error for distant areas within the Spherical-coordinate-based Octree. SCP exhibits excellent universality, making it applicable to various learned point cloud compression techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that SCP surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods by up to 29.14% in point-to-point PSNR BD-Rate.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) semantic segmentation has shown great potential in handling low-light conditions where RGB-based segmentation is hindered by poor RGB imaging quality. The key to RGB-T semantic segmentation is to effectively leverage the complementarity nature of RGB and thermal images. Most existing algorithms fuse RGB and thermal information in feature space via concatenation, element-wise summation, or attention operations in either unidirectional enhancement or bidirectional aggregation manners. However, they usually overlook the modality gap between RGB and thermal images during feature fusion, resulting in modality-specific information from one modality contaminating the other. In this paper, we propose a Channel and Spatial Relation-Propagation Network (CSRPNet) for RGB-T semantic segmentation, which propagates only modality-shared information across different modalities and alleviates the modality-specific information contamination issue. Our CSRPNet first performs relation-propagation in channel and spatial dimensions to capture the modality-shared features from the RGB and thermal features. CSRPNet then aggregates the modality-shared features captured from one modality with the input feature from the other modality to enhance the input feature without the contamination issue. While being fused together, the enhanced RGB and thermal features will be also fed into the subsequent RGB or thermal feature extraction layers for interactive feature fusion, respectively. We also introduce a dual-path cascaded feature refinement module that aggregates multi-layer features to produce two refined features for semantic and boundary prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CSRPNet performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Federated Learning (FL) aggregates locally trained models from individual clients to construct a global model. While FL enables learning a model with data privacy, it often suffers from significant performance degradation when client data distributions are heterogeneous. Many previous FL algorithms have addressed this issue by introducing various proximal restrictions. These restrictions aim to encourage global alignment by constraining the deviation of local learning from the global objective. However, they inherently limit local learning by interfering with the original local objectives. Recently, an alternative approach has emerged to improve local learning generality. By obtaining local models within a smooth loss landscape, this approach mitigates conflicts among different local objectives of the clients. Yet, it does not ensure stable global alignment, as local learning does not take the global objective into account. In this study, we propose Federated Stability on Learning (FedSoL), which combines both the concepts of global alignment and local generality. In FedSoL, the local learning seeks a parameter region robust against proximal perturbations. This strategy introduces an implicit proximal restriction effect in local learning while maintaining the original local objective for parameter update. Our experiments show that FedSoL consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on various setups.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Meshes are widely used in 3D computer vision and graphics, but their irregular topology poses challenges in applying them to existing neural network architectures. Recent advances in mesh neural networks turn to remeshing and push the boundary of pioneer methods that solely take the raw meshes as input. Although the remeshing offers a regular topology that significantly facilitates the design of mesh network architectures, features extracted from such remeshed proxies may struggle to retain the underlying geometry faithfully, limiting the subsequent neural network’s capacity. To address this issue, we propose SieveNet, a novel paradigm that takes into account both the regular topology and the exact geometry. Specifically, this method utilizes structured mesh topology from remeshing and accurate geometric information from distortion-aware point sampling on the surface of the original mesh. Furthermore, our method eliminates the need for hand-crafted feature engineering and can leverage off-the-shelf network architectures such as the vision transformer. Comprehensive experimental results on classification and segmentation tasks well demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recently, large-scale pre-trained vision-language models have presented benefits for alleviating class imbalance in long-tailed recognition. However, the long-tailed data distribution can corrupt the representation space, where the distance between head and tail categories is much larger than the distance between two tail categories. This uneven feature space distribution causes the model to exhibit unclear and inseparable decision boundaries on the uniformly distributed test set, which lowers its performance. To address these challenges, we propose the uniformly category prototype-guided vision-language framework to effectively mitigate feature space bias caused by data imbalance. Especially, we generate a set of category prototypes uniformly distributed on a hypersphere. Category prototype-guided mechanism for image-text matching makes the features of different classes converge to these distinct and uniformly distributed category prototypes, which maintain a uniform distribution in the feature space, and improve class boundaries. Additionally, our proposed irrelevant text filtering and attribute enhancement module allows the model to ignore irrelevant noisy text and focus more on key attribute information, thereby enhancing the robustness of our framework. In the image recognition fine-tuning stage, to address the positive bias problem of the learnable classifier, we design the class feature prototype-guided classifier, which compensates for the performance of tail classes while maintaining the performance of head classes. Our method outperforms previous vision-language methods for long-tailed learning work by a large margin and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>3D object detection has achieved significant performance in many fields, e.g., robotics system, autonomous driving, and augmented reality. However, most existing methods could cause catastrophic forgetting of old classes when performing on the class-incremental scenarios. Meanwhile, the current class-incremental 3D object detection methods neglect the relationships between the object localization information and category semantic information and assume all the knowledge of old model is reliable. To address the above challenge, we present a novel Incremental 3D Object Detection framework with the guidance of prompting, i.e., I3DOD. Specifically, we propose a task-shared prompts mechanism to learn the matching relationships between the object localization information and category semantic information. After training on the current task, these prompts will be stored in our prompt pool, and perform the relationship of old classes in the next task. Moreover, we design a reliable distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from two aspects: a reliable dynamic distillation is developed to filter out the negative knowledge and transfer the reliable 3D knowledge to new detection model; the relation feature is proposed to capture the responses relation in feature space and protect plasticity of the model when learning novel 3D classes. To the end, we conduct comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets and our method outperforms the state-of-the-art object detection methods by 0.6% - 2.7% in terms of <a href="mailto:&#109;&#65;&#80;&#64;&#48;&#x2e;&#x32;&#53;">&#109;&#65;&#80;&#64;&#48;&#x2e;&#x32;&#53;</a>.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to sequentially learn new classes while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previous knowledge. We propose to use Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) as efficient learners for CIL. MAEs were originally designed to learn useful representations through reconstructive unsupervised learning, and they can be easily integrated with a supervised loss for classification. Moreover, MAEs can reliably reconstruct original input images from randomly selected patches, which we use to store exemplars from past tasks more efficiently for CIL. We also propose a bilateral MAE framework to learn from image-level and embedding-level fusion, which produces better-quality reconstructed images and more stable representations. Our experiments confirm that our approach performs better than the state-of-the-art on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full.

<p>Abstract:<br>Vision-and-language pre-training (VLP) models have experienced a surge in popularity recently. By fine-tuning them on specific datasets, significant performance improvements have been observed in various tasks. However, full fine-tuning of VLP models not only consumes a significant amount of computational resources but also has a significant environmental impact. Moreover, as remote sensing (RS) data is constantly being updated, full fine-tuning may not be practical for real-world applications. To address this issue, in this work, we investigate the parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) method to effectively and efficiently transfer visual-language knowledge from the natural domain to the RS domain on the image-text retrieval task. To this end, we make the following contributions. 1) We construct a novel and sophisticated PETL framework for the RS image-text retrieval (RSITR) task, which includes the pretrained CLIP model, a multimodal remote sensing adapter, and a hybrid multi-modal contrastive (HMMC) learning objective; 2) To deal with the problem of high intra-modal similarity in RS data, we design a simple yet effective HMMC loss; 3) We provide comprehensive empirical studies for PETL-based RS image-text retrieval. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method is promising and of great potential for practical applications. 4) We benchmark extensive state-of-the-art PETL methods on the RSITR task. Our proposed model only contains 0.16M training parameters, which can achieve a parameter reduction of 98.9% compared to full fine-tuning, resulting in substantial savings in training costs. Our retrieval performance exceeds traditional methods by 7-13% and achieves comparable or better performance than full fine-tuning. This work can provide new ideas and useful insights for RS vision-language tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Large-scale numerical simulations are capable of generating data up to terabytes or even petabytes. As a promising method of data reduction, super-resolution (SR) has been widely studied in the scientific visualization community. However, most of them are based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or generative adversarial networks (GANs) and the scale factor needs to be determined before constructing the network. As a result, a single training session only supports a fixed factor and has poor generalization ability. To address these problems, this paper proposes a Feature-Enhanced Implicit Neural Representation (FFEINR) for spatio-temporal super-resolution of flow field data. It can take full advantage of the implicit neural representation in terms of model structure and sampling resolution. The neural representation is based on a fully connected network with periodic activation functions, which enables us to obtain lightweight models. The learned continuous representation can decode the low-resolution flow field input data to arbitrary spatial and temporal resolutions, allowing for flexible upsampling. The training process of FFEINR is facilitated by introducing feature enhancements for the input layer, which complements the contextual information of the flow field.To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a series of experiments are conducted on different datasets by setting different hyperparameters. The results show that FFEINR achieves significantly better results than the trilinear interpolation method.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been widely used in skeleton-based human action recognition. In GCN-based methods, the spatio-temporal graph is fundamental for capturing motion patterns. However, existing approaches ignore the physical dependency and synchronized spatio-temporal correlations between joints, which limits the representation capability of GCNs. To solve these problems, we construct the directed diffusion graph for action modeling and introduce the activity partition strategy to optimize the weight sharing mechanism of graph convolution kernels. In addition, we present the spatio-temporal synchronization encoder to embed synchronized spatio-temporal semantics. Finally, we propose Directed Diffusion Graph Convolutional Network (DD-GCN) for action recognition, and the experiments on three public datasets: NTU-RGB+D, NTU-RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is increasingly employed in multi-site research to aid neurological disorder analysis. Existing studies usually suffer from significant cross-site&#x2F;domain data heterogeneity caused by site effects such as differences in scanners&#x2F;protocols. Many methods have been proposed to reduce fMRI heterogeneity between source and target domains, heavily relying on the availability of source data. But acquiring source data is challenging due to privacy concerns and&#x2F;or data storage burdens in multi-site studies. To this end, we design a source-free collaborative domain adaptation (SCDA) framework for fMRI analysis, where only a pretrained source model and unlabeled target data are accessible. Specifically, a multi-perspective feature enrichment method (MFE) is developed for target fMRI analysis, consisting of multiple collaborative branches to dynamically capture fMRI features of unlabeled target data from multiple views. Each branch has a data-feeding module, a spatiotemporal feature encoder, and a class predictor. A mutual-consistency constraint is designed to encourage pair-wise consistency of latent features of the same input generated from these branches for robust representation learning. To facilitate efficient cross-domain knowledge transfer without source data, we initialize MFE using parameters of a pretrained source model. We also introduce an unsupervised pretraining strategy using 3,806 unlabeled fMRIs from three large-scale auxiliary databases, aiming to obtain a general feature encoder. Experimental results on three public datasets and one private dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our method in cross-scanner and cross-study prediction tasks. The model pretrained on large-scale rs-fMRI data has been released to the public.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Image restoration aims to restore high-quality images from degraded counterparts and has seen significant advancements through deep learning techniques. The technique has been widely applied to mobile devices for tasks such as mobile photography. Given the resource limitations on mobile devices, such as memory constraints and runtime requirements, the efficiency of models during deployment becomes paramount. Nevertheless, most previous works have primarily concentrated on analyzing the efficiency of single modules and improving them individually. This paper examines the efficiency across different layers. We propose a roadmap that can be applied to further accelerate image restoration models prior to deployment while simultaneously increasing PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index). The roadmap first increases the model capacity by adding more parameters to partial convolutions on FLOPs non-sensitive layers. Then, it applies partial depthwise convolution coupled with decoupling upsampling&#x2F;downsampling layers to accelerate the model speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach decreases runtime by up to 13% and reduces the number of parameters by up to 23%, while increasing PSNR and SSIM on several image restoration datasets.

<p>Abstract:<br>Existing full text datasets of U.S. public domain newspapers do not recognize the often complex layouts of newspaper scans, and as a result the digitized content scrambles texts from articles, headlines, captions, advertisements, and other layout regions. OCR quality can also be low. This study develops a novel, deep learning pipeline for extracting full article texts from newspaper images and applies it to the nearly 20 million scans in Library of Congress’s public domain Chronicling America collection. The pipeline includes layout detection, legibility classification, custom OCR, and association of article texts spanning multiple bounding boxes. To achieve high scalability, it is built with efficient architectures designed for mobile phones. The resulting American Stories dataset provides high quality data that could be used for pre-training a large language model to achieve better understanding of historical English and historical world knowledge. The dataset could also be added to the external database of a retrieval-augmented language model to make historical information - ranging from interpretations of political events to minutiae about the lives of people’s ancestors - more widely accessible. Furthermore, structured article texts facilitate using transformer-based methods for popular social science applications like topic classification, detection of reproduced content, and news story clustering. Finally, American Stories provides a massive silver quality dataset for innovating multimodal layout analysis models and other multimodal applications.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Producing quality segmentation masks for images is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Recent research has explored large-scale supervised training to enable zero-shot segmentation on virtually any image style and unsupervised training to enable segmentation without dense annotations. However, constructing a model capable of segmenting anything in a zero-shot manner without any annotations is still challenging. In this paper, we propose to utilize the self-attention layers in stable diffusion models to achieve this goal because the pre-trained stable diffusion model has learned inherent concepts of objects within its attention layers. Specifically, we introduce a simple yet effective iterative merging process based on measuring KL divergence among attention maps to merge them into valid segmentation masks. The proposed method does not require any training or language dependency to extract quality segmentation for any images. On COCO-Stuff-27, our method surpasses the prior unsupervised zero-shot SOTA method by an absolute 26% in pixel accuracy and 17% in mean IoU.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>High-resolution (HR) MRI scans obtained from research-grade medical centers provide precise information about imaged tissues. However, routine clinical MRI scans are typically in low-resolution (LR) and vary greatly in contrast and spatial resolution due to the adjustments of the scanning parameters to the local needs of the medical center. End-to-end deep learning methods for MRI super-resolution (SR) have been proposed, but they require re-training each time there is a shift in the input distribution. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that leverages a state-of-the-art 3D brain generative model, the latent diffusion model (LDM) trained on UK BioBank, to increase the resolution of clinical MRI scans. The LDM acts as a generative prior, which has the ability to capture the prior distribution of 3D T1-weighted brain MRI. Based on the architecture of the brain LDM, we find that different methods are suitable for different settings of MRI SR, and thus propose two novel strategies: 1) for SR with more sparsity, we invert through both the decoder of the LDM and also through a deterministic Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM), an approach we will call InverseSR(LDM); 2) for SR with less sparsity, we invert only through the LDM decoder, an approach we will call InverseSR(Decoder). These two approaches search different latent spaces in the LDM model to find the optimal latent code to map the given LR MRI into HR. The training process of the generative model is independent of the MRI under-sampling process, ensuring the generalization of our method to many MRI SR problems with different input measurements. We validate our method on over 100 brain T1w MRIs from the IXI dataset. Our method can demonstrate that powerful priors given by LDM can be used for MRI reconstruction.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Foundation models encompass an extensive knowledge base and offer remarkable transferability. However, this knowledge becomes outdated or insufficient over time. The challenge lies in updating foundation models to accommodate novel information while retaining their original ability. In this paper, we present a novel approach to achieving continual model updates by effecting localized modifications to a small subset of parameters. Guided by insights gleaned from prior analyses of foundational models, we first localize a specific layer for model refinement and then introduce an importance scoring mechanism designed to update only the most crucial weights. Our method is exhaustively evaluated on foundational vision-language models, measuring its efficacy in both learning new information and preserving pre-established knowledge across a diverse spectrum of continual learning tasks, including Aircraft, Birdsnap CIFAR-100, CUB, Cars, and GTSRB. The results show that our method improves the existing continual learning methods by 0.5% - 10% on average, and reduces the loss of pre-trained knowledge from around 5% to 0.97%. Comprehensive ablation studies substantiate our method design, shedding light on the contributions of each component to controllably learning new knowledge and mitigating the forgetting of pre-trained knowledge.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>While hundreds of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are now approved or cleared by the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), many studies have shown inconsistent generalization or latent bias, particularly for underrepresented populations. Some have proposed that generative AI could reduce the need for real data, but its utility in model development remains unclear. Skin disease serves as a useful case study in synthetic image generation due to the diversity of disease appearance, particularly across the protected attribute of skin tone. Here we show that latent diffusion models can scalably generate images of skin disease and that augmenting model training with these data improves performance in data-limited settings. These performance gains saturate at synthetic-to-real image ratios above 10:1 and are substantially smaller than the gains obtained from adding real images. As part of our analysis, we generate and analyze a new dataset of 458,920 synthetic images produced using several generation strategies. Our results suggest that synthetic data could serve as a force-multiplier for model development, but the collection of diverse real-world data remains the most important step to improve medical AI algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The radiance fields style transfer is an emerging field that has recently gained popularity as a means of 3D scene stylization, thanks to the outstanding performance of neural radiance fields in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. We highlight a research gap in radiance fields style transfer, the lack of sufficient perceptual controllability, motivated by the existing concept in the 2D image style transfer. In this paper, we present ARF-Plus, a 3D neural style transfer framework offering manageable control over perceptual factors, to systematically explore the perceptual controllability in 3D scene stylization. Four distinct types of controls - color preservation control, (style pattern) scale control, spatial (selective stylization area) control, and depth enhancement control - are proposed and integrated into this framework. Results from real-world datasets, both quantitative and qualitative, show that the four types of controls in our ARF-Plus framework successfully accomplish their corresponding perceptual controls when stylizing 3D scenes. These techniques work well for individual style inputs as well as for the simultaneous application of multiple styles within a scene. This unlocks a realm of limitless possibilities, allowing customized modifications of stylization effects and flexible merging of the strengths of different styles, ultimately enabling the creation of novel and eye-catching stylistic effects on 3D scenes.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques have recently produced outstanding results in learning visual representations from unlabeled videos. Despite the importance of motion in supervised learning techniques for action recognition, SSL methods often do not explicitly consider motion information in videos. To address this issue, we propose MOFO (MOtion FOcused), a novel SSL method for focusing representation learning on the motion area of a video, for action recognition. MOFO automatically detects motion areas in videos and uses these to guide the self-supervision task. We use a masked autoencoder which randomly masks out a high proportion of the input sequence; we force a specified percentage of the inside of the motion area to be masked and the remainder from outside. We further incorporate motion information into the finetuning step to emphasise motion in the downstream task. We demonstrate that our motion-focused innovations can significantly boost the performance of the currently leading SSL method (VideoMAE) for action recognition. Our method improves the recent self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT), VideoMAE, by achieving +2.6%, +2.1%, +1.3% accuracy on Epic-Kitchens verb, noun and action classification, respectively, and +4.7% accuracy on Something-Something V2 action classification. Our proposed approach significantly improves the performance of the current SSL method for action recognition, indicating the importance of explicitly encoding motion in SSL.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The rapid tracer kinetics of rubidium-82 ($^{82}$Rb) and high variation of cross-frame distribution in dynamic cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) raise significant challenges for inter-frame motion correction, particularly for the early frames where conventional intensity-based image registration techniques are not applicable. Alternatively, a promising approach utilizes generative methods to handle the tracer distribution changes to assist existing registration methods. To improve frame-wise registration and parametric quantification, we propose a Temporally and Anatomically Informed Generative Adversarial Network (TAI-GAN) to transform the early frames into the late reference frame using an all-to-one mapping. Specifically, a feature-wise linear modulation layer encodes channel-wise parameters generated from temporal tracer kinetics information, and rough cardiac segmentations with local shifts serve as the anatomical information. We validated our proposed method on a clinical $^{82}$Rb PET dataset and found that our TAI-GAN can produce converted early frames with high image quality, comparable to the real reference frames. After TAI-GAN conversion, motion estimation accuracy and clinical myocardial blood flow (MBF) quantification were improved compared to using the original frames.

<p>Abstract:<br>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used to build deep learning models for medical image registration, but manually designed network architectures are not necessarily optimal. This paper presents a hierarchical NAS framework (HNAS-Reg), consisting of both convolutional operation search and network topology search, to identify the optimal network architecture for deformable medical image registration. To mitigate the computational overhead and memory constraints, a partial channel strategy is utilized without losing optimization quality. Experiments on three datasets, consisting of 636 T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs), have demonstrated that the proposal method can build a deep learning model with improved image registration accuracy and reduced model size, compared with state-of-the-art image registration approaches, including one representative traditional approach and two unsupervised learning-based approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We present a novel defense, against backdoor attacks on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), wherein adversaries covertly implant malicious behaviors (backdoors) into DNNs. Our defense falls within the category of post-development defenses that operate independently of how the model was generated. The proposed defense is built upon a novel reverse engineering approach that can directly extract backdoor functionality of a given backdoored model to a backdoor expert model. The approach is straightforward – finetuning the backdoored model over a small set of intentionally mislabeled clean samples, such that it unlearns the normal functionality while still preserving the backdoor functionality, and thus resulting in a model (dubbed a backdoor expert model) that can only recognize backdoor inputs. Based on the extracted backdoor expert model, we show the feasibility of devising highly accurate backdoor input detectors that filter out the backdoor inputs during model inference. Further augmented by an ensemble strategy with a finetuned auxiliary model, our defense, BaDExpert (Backdoor Input Detection with Backdoor Expert), effectively mitigates 16 SOTA backdoor attacks while minimally impacting clean utility. The effectiveness of BaDExpert has been verified on multiple datasets (CIFAR10, GTSRB and ImageNet) across various model architectures (ResNet, VGG, MobileNetV2 and Vision Transformer).</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have yielded promising results for both recognizing objects in challenging conditions and modeling aspects of primate vision. However, the representational dynamics of recurrent computations remain poorly understood, especially in large-scale visual models. Here, we studied such dynamics in RNNs trained for object classification on MiniEcoset, a novel subset of ecoset. We report two main insights. First, upon inference, representations continued to evolve after correct classification, suggesting a lack of the notion of being <code>done with classification&#39;&#39;. Second, focusing on </code>readout zones’’ as a way to characterize the activation trajectories, we observe that misclassified representations exhibit activation patterns with lower L2 norm, and are positioned more peripherally in the readout zones. Such arrangements help the misclassified representations move into the correct zones as time progresses. Our findings generalize to networks with lateral and top-down connections, and include both additive and multiplicative interactions with the bottom-up sweep. The results therefore contribute to a general understanding of RNN dynamics in naturalistic tasks. We hope that the analysis framework will aid future investigations of other types of RNNs, including understanding of representational dynamics in primate vision.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We address the problem of unsupervised semantic segmentation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds in diverse traffic scenarios. The key idea is to leverage the spatiotemporal nature of a dynamic point cloud sequence and introduce drastically stronger augmentation by establishing spatiotemporal correspondences across multiple frames. We dovetail clustering and pseudo-label learning in this work. Essentially, we alternate between clustering points into semantic groups and optimizing models using point-wise pseudo-spatiotemporal labels with a simple learning objective. Therefore, our method can learn discriminative features in an unsupervised learning fashion. We show promising segmentation performance on Semantic-KITTI, SemanticPOSS, and FLORIDA benchmark datasets covering scenarios in autonomous vehicle and intersection infrastructure, which is competitive when compared against many existing fully supervised learning methods. This general framework can lead to a unified representation learning approach for LiDAR point clouds incorporating domain knowledge.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Sign language, which conveys meaning through gestures, is the chief means of communication among deaf people. Recognizing sign language in natural settings presents significant challenges due to factors such as lighting, background clutter, and variations in signer characteristics. In this thesis, I study automatic sign language processing in the wild, using signing videos collected from the Internet. This thesis contributes new datasets, tasks, and methods. Most chapters of this thesis address tasks related to fingerspelling, an important component of sign language and yet has not been studied widely by prior work. I present three new large-scale ASL datasets in the wild: ChicagoFSWild, ChicagoFSWild+, and OpenASL. Using ChicagoFSWild and ChicagoFSWild+, I address fingerspelling recognition, which consists of transcribing fingerspelling sequences into text. I propose an end-to-end approach based on iterative attention that allows recognition from a raw video without explicit hand detection. I further show that using a Conformer-based network jointly modeling handshape and mouthing can bring performance close to that of humans. Next, I propose two tasks for building real-world fingerspelling-based applications: fingerspelling detection and search. For fingerspelling detection, I introduce a suite of evaluation metrics and a new detection model via multi-task training. To address the problem of searching for fingerspelled keywords in raw sign language videos, we propose a novel method that jointly localizes and matches fingerspelling segments to text. Finally, I will describe a benchmark for large-vocabulary open-domain sign language translation based on OpenASL. To address the challenges of sign language translation in realistic settings, we propose a set of techniques including sign search as a pretext task for pre-training and fusion of mouthing and handshape features.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art results in estimating brain age, which is an important brain health biomarker, from magnetic resonance (MR) images. However, most of these models only provide a global age prediction, and rely on techniques, such as saliency maps to interpret their results. These saliency maps highlight regions in the input image that were significant for the model’s predictions, but they are hard to be interpreted, and saliency map values are not directly comparable across different samples. In this work, we reframe the age prediction problem from MR images to an image-to-image regression problem where we estimate the brain age for each brain voxel in MR images. We compare voxel-wise age prediction models against global age prediction models and their corresponding saliency maps. The results indicate that voxel-wise age prediction models are more interpretable, since they provide spatial information about the brain aging process, and they benefit from being quantitative.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Generating realistic audio effects for movies and other media is a challenging task that is accomplished today primarily through physical techniques known as Foley art. Foley artists create sounds with common objects (e.g., boxing gloves, broken glass) in time with video as it is playing to generate captivating audio tracks. In this work, we aim to develop a deep-learning based framework that does much the same - observes video in it’s natural sequence and generates realistic audio to accompany it. Notably, we have reason to believe this is achievable due to advancements in realistic audio generation techniques conditioned on other inputs (e.g., Wavenet conditioned on text). We explore several different model architectures to accomplish this task that process both previously-generated audio and video context. These include deep-fusion CNN, dilated Wavenet CNN with visual context, and transformer-based architectures. We find that the transformer-based architecture yields the most promising results, matching low-frequencies to visual patterns effectively, but failing to generate more nuanced waveforms.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has led to important breakthroughs in computer vision by allowing learning from large amounts of unlabeled data. As such, it might have a pivotal role to play in biomedicine where annotating data requires a highly specialized expertise. Yet, there are many healthcare domains for which SSL has not been extensively explored. One such domain is endoscopy, minimally invasive procedures which are commonly used to detect and treat infections, chronic inflammatory diseases or cancer. In this work, we study the use of a leading SSL framework, namely Masked Siamese Networks (MSNs), for endoscopic video analysis such as colonoscopy and laparoscopy. To fully exploit the power of SSL, we create sizable unlabeled endoscopic video datasets for training MSNs. These strong image representations serve as a foundation for secondary training with limited annotated datasets, resulting in state-of-the-art performance in endoscopic benchmarks like surgical phase recognition during laparoscopy and colonoscopic polyp characterization. Additionally, we achieve a 50% reduction in annotated data size without sacrificing performance. Thus, our work provides evidence that SSL can dramatically reduce the need of annotated data in endoscopy.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Image captioning, like many tasks involving vision and language, currently relies on Transformer-based architectures for extracting the semantics in an image and translating it into linguistically coherent descriptions. Although successful, the attention operator only considers a weighted summation of projections of the current input sample, therefore ignoring the relevant semantic information which can come from the joint observation of other samples. In this paper, we devise a network which can perform attention over activations obtained while processing other training samples, through a prototypical memory model. Our memory models the distribution of past keys and values through the definition of prototype vectors which are both discriminative and compact. Experimentally, we assess the performance of the proposed model on the COCO dataset, in comparison with carefully designed baselines and state-of-the-art approaches, and by investigating the role of each of the proposed components. We demonstrate that our proposal can increase the performance of an encoder-decoder Transformer by 3.7 CIDEr points both when training in cross-entropy only and when fine-tuning with self-critical sequence training.

<p>Abstract:<br>Automatic detection of facial Action Units (AUs) allows for objective facial expression analysis. Due to the high cost of AU labeling and the limited size of existing benchmarks, previous AU detection methods tend to overfit the dataset, resulting in a significant performance loss when evaluated across corpora. To address this problem, we propose FG-Net for generalizable facial action unit detection. Specifically, FG-Net extracts feature maps from a StyleGAN2 model pre-trained on a large and diverse face image dataset. Then, these features are used to detect AUs with a Pyramid CNN Interpreter, making the training efficient and capturing essential local features. The proposed FG-Net achieves a strong generalization ability for heatmap-based AU detection thanks to the generalizable and semantic-rich features extracted from the pre-trained generative model. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate within- and cross-corpus AU detection with the widely-used DISFA and BP4D datasets. Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed method achieves superior cross-domain performance while maintaining competitive within-domain performance. In addition, FG-Net is data-efficient and achieves competitive performance even when trained on 1000 samples.

<p>Abstract:<br>We introduce the first multitasking vision transformer adapters that learn generalizable task affinities which can be applied to novel tasks and domains. Integrated into an off-the-shelf vision transformer backbone, our adapters can simultaneously solve multiple dense vision tasks in a parameter-efficient manner, unlike existing multitasking transformers that are parametrically expensive. In contrast to concurrent methods, we do not require retraining or fine-tuning whenever a new task or domain is added. We introduce a task-adapted attention mechanism within our adapter framework that combines gradient-based task similarities with attention-based ones. The learned task affinities generalize to the following settings: zero-shot task transfer, unsupervised domain adaptation, and generalization without fine-tuning to novel domains. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms not only the existing convolutional neural network-based multitasking methods but also the vision transformer-based ones.

<p>Abstract:<br>Open-set face recognition refers to a scenario in which biometric systems have incomplete knowledge of all existing subjects. Therefore, they are expected to prevent face samples of unregistered subjects from being identified as previously enrolled identities. This watchlist context adds an arduous requirement that calls for the dismissal of irrelevant faces by focusing mainly on subjects of interest. As a response, this work introduces a novel method that associates an ensemble of compact neural networks with a margin-based cost function that explores additional samples. Supplementary negative samples can be obtained from external databases or synthetically built at the representation level in training time with a new mix-up feature augmentation approach. Deep neural networks pre-trained on large face datasets serve as the preliminary feature extraction module. We carry out experiments on well-known LFW and IJB-C datasets where results show that the approach is able to boost closed and open-set identification rates.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We present AdVerb, a novel audio-visual dereverberation framework that uses visual cues in addition to the reverberant sound to estimate clean audio. Although audio-only dereverberation is a well-studied problem, our approach incorporates the complementary visual modality to perform audio dereverberation. Given an image of the environment where the reverberated sound signal has been recorded, AdVerb employs a novel geometry-aware cross-modal transformer architecture that captures scene geometry and audio-visual cross-modal relationship to generate a complex ideal ratio mask, which, when applied to the reverberant audio predicts the clean sound. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our approach significantly outperforms traditional audio-only and audio-visual baselines on three downstream tasks: speech enhancement, speech recognition, and speaker verification, with relative improvements in the range of 18% - 82% on the LibriSpeech test-clean set. We also achieve highly satisfactory RT60 error scores on the AVSpeech dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Learning novel concepts, remembering previous knowledge, and adapting it to future tasks occur simultaneously throughout a human’s lifetime. To model such comprehensive abilities, continual zero-shot learning (CZSL) has recently been introduced. However, most existing methods overused unseen semantic information that may not be continually accessible in realistic settings. In this paper, we address the challenge of continual zero-shot learning where unseen information is not provided during training, by leveraging generative modeling. The heart of the generative-based methods is to learn quality representations from seen classes to improve the generative understanding of the unseen visual space. Motivated by this, we introduce generalization-bound tools and provide the first theoretical explanation for the benefits of generative modeling to CZSL tasks. Guided by the theoretical analysis, we then propose our learning algorithm that employs a novel semantically guided Generative Random Walk (GRW) loss. The GRW loss augments the training by continually encouraging the model to generate realistic and characterized samples to represent the unseen space. Our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on AWA1, AWA2, CUB, and SUN datasets, surpassing existing CZSL methods by 3-7%.

<p>Abstract:<br>Due to the growing availability of face anti-spoofing databases, researchers are increasingly focusing on video-based methods that use hundreds to thousands of images to assess their impact on performance. However, there is no clear consensus on the exact number of frames in a video required to improve the performance of face anti-spoofing tasks. Inspired by the visual saliency theory, we present a video summarization method for face anti-spoofing tasks that aims to enhance the performance and efficiency of deep learning models by leveraging visual saliency. In particular, saliency information is extracted from the differences between the Laplacian and Wiener filter outputs of the source images, enabling identification of the most visually salient regions within each frame. Subsequently, the source images are decomposed into base and detail layers, enhancing representation of important information. The weighting maps are then computed based on the saliency information, indicating the importance of each pixel in the image. By linearly combining the base and detail layers using the weighting maps, the method fuses the source images to create a single representative image that summarizes the entire video. The key contribution of our proposed method lies in demonstrating how visual saliency can be used as a data-centric approach to improve the performance and efficiency of face presentation attack detection models. By focusing on the most salient images or regions within the images, a more representative and diverse training set can be created, potentially leading to more effective models. To validate the method’s effectiveness, a simple deep learning architecture (CNN-RNN) was used, and the experimental results showcased state-of-the-art performance on five challenging face anti-spoofing datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Translating images from a source domain to a target domain for learning target models is one of the most common strategies in domain adaptive semantic segmentation (DASS). However, existing methods still struggle to preserve semantically-consistent local details between the original and translated images. In this work, we present an innovative approach that addresses this challenge by using source-domain labels as explicit guidance during image translation. Concretely, we formulate cross-domain image translation as a denoising diffusion process and utilize a novel Semantic Gradient Guidance (SGG) method to constrain the translation process, conditioning it on the pixel-wise source labels. Additionally, a Progressive Translation Learning (PTL) strategy is devised to enable the SGG method to work reliably across domains with large gaps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We present a method for teaching machines to understand and model the underlying spatial common sense of diverse human-object interactions in 3D in a self-supervised way. This is a challenging task, as there exist specific manifolds of the interactions that can be considered human-like and natural, but the human pose and the geometry of objects can vary even for similar interactions. Such diversity makes the annotating task of 3D interactions difficult and hard to scale, which limits the potential to reason about that in a supervised way. One way of learning the 3D spatial relationship between humans and objects during interaction is by showing multiple 2D images captured from different viewpoints when humans interact with the same type of objects. The core idea of our method is to leverage a generative model that produces high-quality 2D images from an arbitrary text prompt input as an “unbounded” data generator with effective controllability and view diversity. Despite its imperfection of the image quality over real images, we demonstrate that the synthesized images are sufficient to learn the 3D human-object spatial relations. We present multiple strategies to leverage the synthesized images, including (1) the first method to leverage a generative image model for 3D human-object spatial relation learning; (2) a framework to reason about the 3D spatial relations from inconsistent 2D cues in a self-supervised manner via 3D occupancy reasoning with pose canonicalization; (3) semantic clustering to disambiguate different types of interactions with the same object types; and (4) a novel metric to assess the quality of 3D spatial learning of interaction.

<p>Abstract:<br>Since thermal imagery offers a unique modality to investigate pain, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) has collected a large and diverse set of cancer patient facial thermograms for AI-based pain research. However, differing angles from camera capture between thermal and visible sensors has led to misalignment between Visible-Thermal (VT) images. We modernize the classic computer vision task of image registration by applying and modifying a generative alignment algorithm to register VT cancer faces, without the need for a reference or alignment parameters. By registering VT faces, we demonstrate that the quality of thermal images produced in the generative AI downstream task of Visible-to-Thermal (V2T) image translation significantly improves up to 52.5%, than without registration. Images in this paper have been approved by the NIH NCI for public dissemination.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The automatic analysis of chemical literature has immense potential to accelerate the discovery of new materials and drugs. Much of the critical information in patent documents and scientific articles is contained in figures, depicting the molecule structures. However, automatically parsing the exact chemical structure is a formidable challenge, due to the amount of detailed information, the diversity of drawing styles, and the need for training data. In this work, we introduce MolGrapher to recognize chemical structures visually. First, a deep keypoint detector detects the atoms. Second, we treat all candidate atoms and bonds as nodes and put them in a graph. This construct allows a natural graph representation of the molecule. Last, we classify atom and bond nodes in the graph with a Graph Neural Network. To address the lack of real training data, we propose a synthetic data generation pipeline producing diverse and realistic results. In addition, we introduce a large-scale benchmark of annotated real molecule images, USPTO-30K, to spur research on this critical topic. Extensive experiments on five datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms classical and learning-based methods in most settings. Code, models, and datasets are available.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Image segmentation plays an essential role in nuclei image analysis. Recently, the segment anything model has made a significant breakthrough in such tasks. However, the current model exists two major issues for cell segmentation: (1) the image encoder of the segment anything model involves a large number of parameters. Retraining or even fine-tuning the model still requires expensive computational resources. (2) in point prompt mode, points are sampled from the center of the ground truth and more than one set of points is expected to achieve reliable performance, which is not efficient for practical applications. In this paper, a single-point prompt network is proposed for nuclei image segmentation, called SPPNet. We replace the original image encoder with a lightweight vision transformer. Also, an effective convolutional block is added in parallel to extract the low-level semantic information from the image and compensate for the performance degradation due to the small image encoder. We propose a new point-sampling method based on the Gaussian kernel. The proposed model is evaluated on the MoNuSeg-2018 dataset. The result demonstrated that SPPNet outperforms existing U-shape architectures and shows faster convergence in training. Compared to the segment anything model, SPPNet shows roughly 20 times faster inference, with 1&#x2F;70 parameters and computational cost. Particularly, only one set of points is required in both the training and inference phases, which is more reasonable for clinical applications.
