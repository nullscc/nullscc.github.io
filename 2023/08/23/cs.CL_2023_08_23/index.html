<p>Abstract:<br>We examine the disconnect between scholarship and practice in applying machine learning to trust and safety problems, using misinformation detection as a case study. We systematize literature on automated detection of misinformation across a corpus of 270 well-cited papers in the field. We then examine subsets of papers for data and code availability, design missteps, reproducibility, and generalizability. We find significant shortcomings in the literature that call into question claimed performance and practicality. Detection tasks are often meaningfully distinct from the challenges that online services actually face. Datasets and model evaluation are often non-representative of real-world contexts, and evaluation frequently is not independent of model training. Data and code availability is poor. Models do not generalize well to out-of-domain data. Based on these results, we offer recommendations for evaluating machine learning applications to trust and safety problems. Our aim is for future work to avoid the pitfalls that we identify.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Curriculum learning (CL) posits that machine learning models – similar to humans – may learn more efficiently from data that match their current learning progress. However, CL methods are still poorly understood and, in particular for natural language processing (NLP), have achieved only limited success. In this paper, we explore why. Starting from an attempt to replicate and extend a number of recent curriculum methods, we find that their results are surprisingly brittle when applied to NLP. A deep dive into the (in)effectiveness of the curricula in some scenarios shows us why: when curricula are employed in combination with the popular Adam optimisation algorithm, they oftentimes learn to adapt to suboptimally chosen optimisation parameters for this algorithm. We present a number of different case studies with different common hand-crafted and automated CL approaches to illustrate this phenomenon, and we find that none of them outperforms optimisation with only Adam with well-chosen hyperparameters. As such, our results contribute to understanding why CL methods work, but at the same time urge caution when claiming positive results.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>As increasingly sophisticated language models emerge, their trustworthiness becomes a pivotal issue, especially in tasks such as summarization and question-answering. Ensuring their responses are contextually grounded and faithful is challenging due to the linguistic diversity and the myriad of possible answers. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to evaluate faithfulness of machine-generated text by computing the longest noncontinuous substring of the claim that is supported by the context, which we refer to as the Longest Supported Subsequence (LSS). Using a new human-annotated dataset, we finetune a model to generate LSS. We introduce a new method of evaluation and demonstrate that these metrics correlate better with human ratings when LSS is employed, as opposed to when it is not. Our proposed metric demonstrates an 18% enhancement over the prevailing state-of-the-art metric for faithfulness on our dataset. Our metric consistently outperforms other metrics on a summarization dataset across six different models. Finally, we compare several popular Large Language Models (LLMs) for faithfulness using this metric. We release the human-annotated dataset built for predicting LSS and our fine-tuned model for evaluating faithfulness.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Automatic semantic change methods try to identify the changes that appear over time in the meaning of words by analyzing their usage in diachronic corpora. In this paper, we analyze different strategies to create static and contextual word embedding models, i.e., Word2Vec and ELMo, on real-world English and Romanian datasets. To test our pipeline and determine the performance of our models, we first evaluate both word embedding models on an English dataset (SEMEVAL-CCOHA). Afterward, we focus our experiments on a Romanian dataset, and we underline different aspects of semantic changes in this low-resource language, such as meaning acquisition and loss. The experimental results show that, depending on the corpus, the most important factors to consider are the choice of model and the distance to calculate a score for detecting semantic change.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Large language models (LLMs) are capable of performing conditional sequence generation tasks, such as translation or summarization, through instruction fine-tuning. The fine-tuning data is generally sequentially concatenated from a specific task instruction, an input sentence, and the corresponding response. Considering the locality modeled by the self-attention mechanism of LLMs, these models face the risk of instruction forgetting when generating responses for long input sentences. To mitigate this issue, we propose enhancing the instruction-following capability of LLMs by shifting the position of task instructions after the input sentences. Theoretical analysis suggests that our straightforward method can alter the model’s learning focus, thereby emphasizing the training of instruction-following capabilities. Concurrently, experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms traditional settings across various model scales (1B &#x2F; 7B &#x2F; 13B) and different sequence generation tasks (translation and summarization), without any additional data or annotation costs. Notably, our method significantly improves the zero-shot performance on conditional sequence generation, e.g., up to 9.7 BLEU points on WMT zero-shot translation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread popularity across diverse domains involving text generation, summarization, and various natural language processing tasks. Despite their inherent limitations, LLM-based designs have shown promising capabilities in planning and navigating open-world scenarios. This paper introduces a novel application of pre-trained LLMs as agents within cybersecurity network environments, focusing on their utility for sequential decision-making processes.   We present an approach wherein pre-trained LLMs are leveraged as attacking agents in two reinforcement learning environments. Our proposed agents demonstrate similar or better performance against state-of-the-art agents trained for thousands of episodes in most scenarios and configurations. In addition, the best LLM agents perform similarly to human testers of the environment without any additional training process. This design highlights the potential of LLMs to efficiently address complex decision-making tasks within cybersecurity.   Furthermore, we introduce a new network security environment named NetSecGame. The environment is designed to eventually support complex multi-agent scenarios within the network security domain. The proposed environment mimics real network attacks and is designed to be highly modular and adaptable for various scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Multimodal large language models acquire their instruction-following capabilities through a two-stage training process: pre-training on image-text pairs and fine-tuning on supervised vision-language instruction data. Recent studies have shown that large language models can achieve satisfactory results even with a limited amount of high-quality instruction-following data. In this paper, we introduce InstructionGPT-4, which is fine-tuned on a small dataset comprising only 200 examples, amounting to approximately 6% of the instruction-following data used in the alignment dataset for MiniGPT-4. We first propose several metrics to access the quality of multimodal instruction data. Based on these metrics, we present a simple and effective data selector to automatically identify and filter low-quality vision-language data. By employing this method, InstructionGPT-4 outperforms the original MiniGPT-4 on various evaluations (e.g., visual question answering, GPT-4 preference). Overall, our findings demonstrate that less but high-quality instruction tuning data is efficient to enable multimodal large language models to generate better output.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Knowledge base question answering (KBQA) is a critical yet challenging task due to the vast number of entities within knowledge bases and the diversity of natural language questions posed by users. Unfortunately, the performance of most KBQA models tends to decline significantly in real-world scenarios where high-quality annotated data is insufficient. To mitigate the burden associated with manual annotation, we introduce FlexKBQA by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) as program translators for addressing the challenges inherent in the few-shot KBQA task. Specifically, FlexKBQA leverages automated algorithms to sample diverse programs, such as SPARQL queries, from the knowledge base, which are subsequently converted into natural language questions via LLMs. This synthetic dataset facilitates training a specialized lightweight model for the KB. Additionally, to reduce the barriers of distribution shift between synthetic data and real user questions, FlexKBQA introduces an executionguided self-training method to iterative leverage unlabeled user questions. Furthermore, we explore harnessing the inherent reasoning capability of LLMs to enhance the entire framework. Consequently, FlexKBQA delivers substantial flexibility, encompassing data annotation, deployment, and being domain agnostic. Through extensive experiments on GrailQA, WebQSP, and KQA Pro, we observe that under the few-shot even the more challenging zero-shot scenarios, FlexKBQA achieves impressive results with a few annotations, surpassing all previous baselines and even approaching the performance of supervised models, achieving a remarkable 93% performance relative to the fully-supervised models. We posit that FlexKBQA represents a significant advancement towards exploring better integration of large and lightweight models. The code is open-sourced.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Learning from human preferences is crucial for language models (LMs) to effectively cater to human needs and societal values. Previous research has made notable progress by leveraging human feedback to follow instructions. However, these approaches rely primarily on online reinforcement learning (RL) techniques like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which have been proven unstable and challenging to tune for language models. Moreover, PPO requires complex distributed system implementation, hindering the efficiency of large-scale distributed training. In this study, we propose an offline reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) framework to align LMs using pre-generated samples without interacting with RL environments. Specifically, we explore maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with filtering, reward-weighted regression (RWR), and Decision Transformer (DT) to align language models to human preferences. By employing a loss function similar to supervised fine-tuning, our methods ensure more stable model training than PPO with a simple machine learning system~(MLSys) and much fewer (around 12.3%) computing resources. Experimental results demonstrate the DT alignment outperforms other Offline RLHF methods and is better than PPO.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The large-scale visual-language pre-trained model, Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), has significantly improved image captioning for scenarios without human-annotated image-caption pairs. Recent advanced CLIP-based image captioning without human annotations follows a text-only training paradigm, i.e., reconstructing text from shared embedding space. Nevertheless, these approaches are limited by the training&#x2F;inference gap or huge storage requirements for text embeddings. Given that it is trivial to obtain images in the real world, we propose CLIP-guided text GAN (CgT-GAN), which incorporates images into the training process to enable the model to “see” real visual modality. Particularly, we use adversarial training to teach CgT-GAN to mimic the phrases of an external text corpus and CLIP-based reward to provide semantic guidance. The caption generator is jointly rewarded based on the caption naturalness to human language calculated from the GAN’s discriminator and the semantic guidance reward computed by the CLIP-based reward module. In addition to the cosine similarity as the semantic guidance reward (i.e., CLIP-cos), we further introduce a novel semantic guidance reward called CLIP-agg, which aligns the generated caption with a weighted text embedding by attentively aggregating the entire corpus. Experimental results on three subtasks (ZS-IC, In-UIC and Cross-UIC) show that CgT-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly across all metrics.

<p>Abstract:<br>With the increasing size of pre-trained language models (PLMs), fine-tuning all the parameters in the model is not efficient, especially when there are a large number of downstream tasks, which incur significant training and storage costs. Many parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches have been proposed, among which, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a representative approach that injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into every target module. Yet LoRA ignores the importance of parameters in different modules. To address this problem, many works have been proposed to prune the parameters of LoRA. However, under limited training conditions, the upper bound of the rank of the pruned parameter matrix is still affected by the preset values. We, therefore, propose IncreLoRA, an incremental parameter allocation method that adaptively adds trainable parameters during training based on the importance scores of each module. This approach is different from the pruning method as it is not limited by the initial number of training parameters, and each parameter matrix has a higher rank upper bound for the same training overhead. We conduct extensive experiments on GLUE to demonstrate the effectiveness of IncreLoRA. The results show that our method owns higher parameter efficiency, especially when under the low-resource settings where our method significantly outperforms the baselines. Our code is publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Large-scale text retrieval technology has been widely used in various practical business scenarios. This paper presents our systems for the TREC 2022 Deep Learning Track. We explain the hybrid text retrieval and multi-stage text ranking method adopted in our solution. The retrieval stage combined the two structures of traditional sparse retrieval and neural dense retrieval. In the ranking stage, in addition to the full interaction-based ranking model built on large pre-trained language model, we also proposes a lightweight sub-ranking module to further enhance the final text ranking performance. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Our models achieve the 1st and 4th rank on the test set of passage ranking and document ranking respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recently there has been a significant surge in multimodal learning in terms of both image-to-text and text-to-image generation. However, the success is typically limited to English, leaving other languages largely behind. Building a competitive counterpart in other languages is highly challenging due to the low-resource nature of non-English multimodal data (i.e., lack of large-scale, high-quality image-text data). In this work, we propose MPM, an effective training paradigm for training large multimodal models in low-resource languages. MPM demonstrates that Multilingual language models can Pivot zero-shot Multimodal learning across languages. Specifically, based on a strong multilingual large language model, multimodal models pretrained on English-only image-text data can well generalize to other languages in a zero-shot manner for both image-to-text and text-to-image generation, even surpassing models trained on image-text data in native languages. Taking Chinese as a practice of MPM, we build large multimodal models VisCPM in image-to-text and text-to-image generation, which achieve state-of-the-art (open-source) performance in Chinese.

<p>Abstract:<br>As an effective tool for eliciting the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompting has recently demonstrated unprecedented abilities across a variety of complex tasks. To further improve the performance, prompt ensemble has attracted substantial interest for tackling the hallucination and instability of LLMs. However, existing methods usually adopt a two-stage paradigm, which requires a pre-prepared set of prompts with substantial manual effort, and is unable to perform directed optimization for different weak learners. In this paper, we propose a simple, universal, and automatic method named PREFER (Pompt Ensemble learning via Feedback-Reflect-Refine) to address the stated limitations. Specifically, given the fact that weak learners are supposed to focus on hard examples during boosting, PREFER builds a feedback mechanism for reflecting on the inadequacies of existing weak learners. Based on this, the LLM is required to automatically synthesize new prompts for iterative refinement. Moreover, to enhance stability of the prompt effect evaluation, we propose a novel prompt bagging method involving forward and backward thinking, which is superior to majority voting and is beneficial for both feedback and weight calculation in boosting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PREFER achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple types of tasks by a significant margin. We have made our code publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In the realm of Large Language Models, the balance between instruction data quality and quantity has become a focal point. Recognizing this, we introduce a self-guided methodology for LLMs to autonomously discern and select cherry samples from vast open-source datasets, effectively minimizing manual curation and potential cost for instruction tuning an LLM. Our key innovation, the Instruction-Following Difficulty (IFD) metric, emerges as a pivotal tool to identify discrepancies between a model’s expected responses and its autonomous generation prowess. Through the adept application of IFD, cherry samples are pinpointed, leading to a marked uptick in model training efficiency. Empirical validations on renowned datasets like Alpaca and WizardLM underpin our findings; with a mere 10% of conventional data input, our strategy showcases improved results. This synthesis of self-guided cherry-picking and the IFD metric signifies a transformative leap in the optimization of LLMs, promising both efficiency and resource-conscious advancements.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recently, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 have attracted great attention given their surprising improvement and performance. Length controlled generation of LLMs emerges as an important topic, which also enables users to fully leverage the capability of LLMs in more real-world scenarios like generating a proper answer or essay of a desired length. In addition, the autoregressive generation in LLMs is extremely time-consuming, while the ability of controlling this generated length can arbitrarily reduce the inference cost by limiting the length, and thus satisfy different needs. Therefore, we aim to propose a prompt-based length control method to achieve this length controlled generation, which can also be widely applied in GPT-style LLMs. In particular, we adopt reinforcement learning with the reward signal given by either trainable or rule-based reward model, which further affects the generation of LLMs via rewarding a pre-defined target length. Experiments show that our method significantly improves the accuracy of prompt-based length control for summarization task on popular datasets like CNNDM and NYT. We believe this length-controllable ability can provide more potentials towards the era of LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The Biomedical Entity Normalization (BEN) task aims to align raw, unstructured medical entities to standard entities, thus promoting data coherence and facilitating better downstream medical applications. Recently, prompt learning methods have shown promising results in this task. However, existing research falls short in tackling the more complex Chinese BEN task, especially in the few-shot scenario with limited medical data, and the vast potential of the external medical knowledge base has yet to be fully harnessed. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Knowledge-injected Prompt Learning (PL-Knowledge) method. Specifically, our approach consists of five stages: candidate entity matching, knowledge extraction, knowledge encoding, knowledge injection, and prediction output. By effectively encoding the knowledge items contained in medical entities and incorporating them into our tailor-made knowledge-injected templates, the additional knowledge enhances the model’s ability to capture latent relationships between medical entities, thus achieving a better match with the standard entities. We extensively evaluate our model on a benchmark dataset in both few-shot and full-scale scenarios. Our method outperforms existing baselines, with an average accuracy boost of 12.96% in few-shot and 0.94% in full-data cases, showcasing its excellence in the BEN task.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Passage reranking is a crucial task in many applications, particularly when dealing with large-scale documents. Traditional neural architectures are limited in retrieving the best passage for a question because they usually match the question to each passage separately, seldom considering contextual information in other passages that can provide comparison and reference information. This paper presents a list-context attention mechanism to augment the passage representation by incorporating the list-context information from other candidates. The proposed coarse-to-fine (C2F) neural retriever addresses the out-of-memory limitation of the passage attention mechanism by dividing the list-context modeling process into two sub-processes, allowing for efficient encoding of context information from a large number of candidate answers. This method can be generally used to encode context information from any number of candidate answers in one pass. Different from most multi-stage information retrieval architectures, this model integrates the coarse and fine rankers into the joint optimization process, allowing for feedback between the two layers to update the model simultaneously. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Big models, exemplified by Large Language Models (LLMs), are models typically pre-trained on massive data and comprised of enormous parameters, which not only obtain significantly improved performance across diverse tasks but also present emergent capabilities absent in smaller models. However, the growing intertwining of big models with everyday human lives poses potential risks and might cause serious social harm. Therefore, many efforts have been made to align LLMs with humans to make them better follow user instructions and satisfy human preferences. Nevertheless, &#96;what to align with’ has not been fully discussed, and inappropriate alignment goals might even backfire. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of different alignment goals in existing work and trace their evolution paths to help identify the most essential goal. Particularly, we investigate related works from two perspectives: the definition of alignment goals and alignment evaluation. Our analysis encompasses three distinct levels of alignment goals and reveals a goal transformation from fundamental abilities to value orientation, indicating the potential of intrinsic human values as the alignment goal for enhanced LLMs. Based on such results, we further discuss the challenges of achieving such intrinsic value alignment and provide a collection of available resources for future research on the alignment of big models.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Intertextual allusions hold a pivotal role in Classical Philology, with Latin authors frequently referencing Ancient Greek texts. Until now, the automatic identification of these intertextual references has been constrained to monolingual approaches, seeking parallels solely within Latin or Greek texts. In this study, we introduce SPhilBERTa, a trilingual Sentence-RoBERTa model tailored for Classical Philology, which excels at cross-lingual semantic comprehension and identification of identical sentences across Ancient Greek, Latin, and English. We generate new training data by automatically translating English texts into Ancient Greek. Further, we present a case study, demonstrating SPhilBERTa’s capability to facilitate automated detection of intertextual parallels.

<p>Abstract:<br>Building socialbots that can have deep, engaging open-domain conversations with humans is one of the grand challenges of artificial intelligence (AI). To this end, bots need to be able to leverage world knowledge spanning several domains effectively when conversing with humans who have their own world knowledge. Existing knowledge-grounded conversation datasets are primarily stylized with explicit roles for conversation partners. These datasets also do not explore depth or breadth of topical coverage with transitions in conversations. We introduce Topical-Chat, a knowledge-grounded human-human conversation dataset where the underlying knowledge spans 8 broad topics and conversation partners don’t have explicitly defined roles, to help further research in open-domain conversational AI. We also train several state-of-the-art encoder-decoder conversational models on Topical-Chat and perform automated and human evaluation for benchmarking.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Building scalable vision-language models to learn from diverse, multimodal data remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce an Efficient Vision-languagE foundation model, namely EVE, which is one unified multimodal Transformer pre-trained solely by one unified pre-training task. Specifically, EVE encodes both vision and language within a shared Transformer network integrated with modality-aware sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) modules, which capture modality-specific information by selectively switching to different experts. To unify pre-training tasks of vision and language, EVE performs masked signal modeling on image-text pairs to reconstruct masked signals, i.e., image pixels and text tokens, given visible signals. This simple yet effective pre-training objective accelerates training by 3.5x compared to the model pre-trained with Image-Text Contrastive and Image-Text Matching losses. Owing to the combination of the unified architecture and pre-training task, EVE is easy to scale up, enabling better downstream performance with fewer resources and faster training speed. Despite its simplicity, EVE achieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language downstream tasks, including visual question answering, visual reasoning, and image-text retrieval.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Text-based audio generation models have limitations as they cannot encompass all the information in audio, leading to restricted controllability when relying solely on text. To address this issue, we propose a novel model that enhances the controllability of existing pre-trained text-to-audio models by incorporating additional conditions including content (timestamp) and style (pitch contour and energy contour) as supplements to the text. This approach achieves fine-grained control over the temporal order, pitch, and energy of generated audio. To preserve the diversity of generation, we employ a trainable control condition encoder that is enhanced by a large language model and a trainable Fusion-Net to encode and fuse the additional conditions while keeping the weights of the pre-trained text-to-audio model frozen. Due to the lack of suitable datasets and evaluation metrics, we consolidate existing datasets into a new dataset comprising the audio and corresponding conditions and use a series of evaluation metrics to evaluate the controllability performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our model successfully achieves fine-grained control to accomplish controllable audio generation.

<p>Abstract:<br>We proposed Audio Difference Captioning (ADC) as a new extension task of audio captioning for describing the semantic differences between input pairs of similar but slightly different audio clips. The ADC solves the problem that conventional audio captioning sometimes generates similar captions for similar audio clips, failing to describe the difference in content. We also propose a cross-attention-concentrated transformer encoder to extract differences by comparing a pair of audio clips and a similarity-discrepancy disentanglement to emphasize the difference in the latent space. To evaluate the proposed methods, we built an AudioDiffCaps dataset consisting of pairs of similar but slightly different audio clips with human-annotated descriptions of their differences. The experiment with the AudioDiffCaps dataset showed that the proposed methods solve the ADC task effectively and improve the attention weights to extract the difference by visualizing them in the transformer encoder.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Decision-making problems can be represented as mathematical optimization models, finding wide applications in fields such as economics, engineering and manufacturing, transportation, and health care. Optimization models are mathematical abstractions of the problem of making the best decision while satisfying a set of requirements or constraints. One of the primary barriers to deploying these models in practice is the challenge of helping practitioners understand and interpret such models, particularly when they are infeasible, meaning no decision satisfies all the constraints. Existing methods for diagnosing infeasible optimization models often rely on expert systems, necessitating significant background knowledge in optimization. In this paper, we introduce OptiChat, a first-of-its-kind natural language-based system equipped with a chatbot GUI for engaging in interactive conversations about infeasible optimization models. OptiChat can provide natural language descriptions of the optimization model itself, identify potential sources of infeasibility, and offer suggestions to make the model feasible. The implementation of OptiChat is built on GPT-4, which interfaces with an optimization solver to identify the minimal subset of constraints that render the entire optimization problem infeasible, also known as the Irreducible Infeasible Subset (IIS). We utilize few-shot learning, expert chain-of-thought, key-retrieve, and sentiment prompts to enhance OptiChat’s reliability. Our experiments demonstrate that OptiChat assists both expert and non-expert users in improving their understanding of the optimization models, enabling them to quickly identify the sources of infeasibility.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In the realm of natural language processing, the understanding of tabular data has perpetually stood as a focal point of scholarly inquiry. The emergence of expansive language models, exemplified by the likes of ChatGPT, has ushered in a wave of endeavors wherein researchers aim to harness these models for tasks related to table-based question answering. Central to our investigative pursuits is the elucidation of methodologies that amplify the aptitude of such large language models in discerning both the structural intricacies and inherent content of tables, ultimately facilitating their capacity to provide informed responses to pertinent queries. To this end, we have architected a distinctive module dedicated to the serialization of tables for seamless integration with expansive language models. Additionally, we’ve instituted a corrective mechanism within the model to rectify potential inaccuracies. Experimental results indicate that, although our proposed method trails the SOTA by approximately 11.7% in overall metrics, it surpasses the SOTA by about 1.2% in tests on specific datasets. This research marks the first application of large language models to table-based question answering tasks, enhancing the model’s comprehension of both table structures and content.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The strategy of training the model from scratch in a specific language or domain serves two essential purposes: i) enhancing performance in the particular linguistic or domain context, and ii) ensuring effective tokenization. The main limitation inherent to this approach lies in the associated cost, which can reach six to seven-digit dollar values, depending on the model size and the number of parameters involved.   The main solution to overcome the cost challenge is to rely on available pre-trained models, which, despite recent advancements such as the LLaMA and LLaMA-2 models, still demonstrate inefficiency for certain specific domain problems or prove ineffective in scenarios involving conversational memory resources, given the large number of tokens required to represent text.   To overcome this issue, we present a methodology named Cabrita, which, as our research demonstrates, successfully addresses the performance and efficient tokenization problem, all at an affordable cost. We believe that this methodology can be applied to any transformer-like architecture model. To validate the study, we conducted continuous pre-training exclusively using Portuguese text on a 3-billion-parameter model known as OpenLLaMA, resulting in a model named openCabrita 3B. The openCabrita 3B also features a new tokenizer that results in a significant reduction in the number of tokens required to represent the text. In our assessment, for few-shot learning tasks, we achieved similar results with this 3B model compared to a traditional continuous pre-training approach as well as to 7B models English pre-trained models.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Large language models such as Open AI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models are proficient at answering questions, but their knowledge is confined to the information present in their training data. This limitation renders them ineffective when confronted with questions about recent developments or non-public documents. Our research proposes a method that enables GPT models to answer questions by employing context from an information source not previously included in their training data. The methodology includes preprocessing of contextual information, the embedding of contexts and queries, constructing prompt through the integration of context embeddings, and generating answers using GPT models. We applied this method in a controlled test scenario using the California Driver’s Handbook as the information source. The GPT-3 model achieved a 96% passing score on a set of 50 sample driving knowledge test questions. In contrast, without context, the model’s passing score fell to 82%. However, the model still fails to answer some questions correctly even with providing library of context, highlighting room for improvement. The research also examined the impact of prompt length and context format, on the model’s performance. Overall, the study provides insights into the limitations and potential improvements for GPT models in question-answering tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities for text rewriting. Nonetheless, the large sizes of these models make them impractical for on-device inference, which would otherwise allow for enhanced privacy and economical inference. Creating a smaller yet potent language model for text rewriting presents a formidable challenge because it requires balancing the need for a small size with the need to retain the emergent capabilities of the LLM, that requires costly data collection. To address the above challenge, we introduce a new instruction tuning approach for building a mobile-centric text rewriting model. Our strategies enable the generation of high quality training data without any human labeling. In addition, we propose a heuristic reinforcement learning framework which substantially enhances performance without requiring preference data. To further bridge the performance gap with the larger server-side model, we propose an effective approach that combines the mobile rewrite agent with the server model using a cascade. To tailor the text rewriting tasks to mobile scenarios, we introduce MessageRewriteEval, a benchmark that focuses on text rewriting for messages through natural language instructions. Through empirical experiments, we demonstrate that our on-device model surpasses the current state-of-the-art LLMs in text rewriting while maintaining a significantly reduced model size. Notably, we show that our proposed cascading approach improves model performance.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Most current methods for detecting anomalies in text concentrate on constructing models solely relying on unlabeled data. These models operate on the presumption that no labeled anomalous examples are available, which prevents them from utilizing prior knowledge of anomalies that are typically present in small numbers in many real-world applications. Furthermore, these models prioritize learning feature embeddings rather than optimizing anomaly scores directly, which could lead to suboptimal anomaly scoring and inefficient use of data during the learning process. In this paper, we introduce FATE, a deep few-shot learning-based framework that leverages limited anomaly examples and learns anomaly scores explicitly in an end-to-end method using deviation learning. In this approach, the anomaly scores of normal examples are adjusted to closely resemble reference scores obtained from a prior distribution. Conversely, anomaly samples are forced to have anomalous scores that considerably deviate from the reference score in the upper tail of the prior. Additionally, our model is optimized to learn the distinct behavior of anomalies by utilizing a multi-head self-attention layer and multiple instance learning approaches. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach attains a new level of state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Language use has been shown to correlate with depression, but large-scale validation is needed. Traditional methods like clinic studies are expensive. So, natural language processing has been employed on social media to predict depression, but limitations remain-lack of validated labels, biased user samples, and no context. Our study identified 29 topics in 3919 smartphone-collected speech recordings from 265 participants using the Whisper tool and BERTopic model. Six topics with a median PHQ-8 greater than or equal to 10 were regarded as risk topics for depression: No Expectations, Sleep, Mental Therapy, Haircut, Studying, and Coursework. To elucidate the topic emergence and associations with depression, we compared behavioral (from wearables) and linguistic characteristics across identified topics. The correlation between topic shifts and changes in depression severity over time was also investigated, indicating the importance of longitudinally monitoring language use. We also tested the BERTopic model on a similar smaller dataset (356 speech recordings from 57 participants), obtaining some consistent results. In summary, our findings demonstrate specific speech topics may indicate depression severity. The presented data-driven workflow provides a practical approach to collecting and analyzing large-scale speech data from real-world settings for digital health research.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP). Although convenient for research and practical applications, open-source LLMs with fewer parameters often suffer from severe hallucinations compared to their larger counterparts. This paper focuses on measuring and reducing hallucinations in BLOOM 7B, a representative of such weaker open-source LLMs that are publicly available for research and commercial applications. We introduce HaloCheck, a lightweight BlackBox knowledge-free framework designed to quantify the severity of hallucinations in LLMs. Additionally, we explore techniques like knowledge injection and teacher-student approaches to alleviate hallucinations in low-parameter LLMs. Our experiments effectively demonstrate the reduction of hallucinations in challenging domains for these LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The ‘pre-train, prompt, predict’ paradigm of large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable success in open-domain question answering (OD-QA). However, few works explore this paradigm in the scenario of multi-document question answering (MD-QA), a task demanding a thorough understanding of the logical associations among the contents and structures of different documents. To fill this crucial gap, we propose a Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP) method to formulate the right context in prompting LLMs for MD-QA, which consists of a graph construction module and a graph traversal module. For graph construction, we create a knowledge graph (KG) over multiple documents with nodes symbolizing passages or document structures (e.g., pages&#x2F;tables), and edges denoting the semantic&#x2F;lexical similarity between passages or intra-document structural relations. For graph traversal, we design an LM-guided graph traverser that navigates across nodes and gathers supporting passages assisting LLMs in MD-QA. The constructed graph serves as the global ruler that regulates the transitional space among passages and reduces retrieval latency. Concurrently, the LM-guided traverser acts as a local navigator that gathers pertinent context to progressively approach the question and guarantee retrieval quality. Extensive experiments underscore the efficacy of KGP for MD-QA, signifying the potential of leveraging graphs in enhancing the prompt design for LLMs. Our code is at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/YuWVandy/KG-LLM-MDQA">https://github.com/YuWVandy/KG-LLM-MDQA</a>.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The increasing versatility of language models LMs has given rise to a new class of benchmarks that comprehensively assess a broad range of capabilities. Such benchmarks are associated with massive computational costs reaching thousands of GPU hours per model. However the efficiency aspect of these evaluation efforts had raised little discussion in the literature. In this work we present the problem of Efficient Benchmarking namely intelligently reducing the computation costs of LM evaluation without compromising reliability. Using the HELM benchmark as a test case we investigate how different benchmark design choices affect the computation-reliability tradeoff. We propose to evaluate the reliability of such decisions by using a new measure Decision Impact on Reliability DIoR for short. We find for example that the current leader on HELM may change by merely removing a low-ranked model from the benchmark and observe that a handful of examples suffice to obtain the correct benchmark ranking. Conversely a slightly different choice of HELM scenarios varies ranking widely. Based on our findings we outline a set of concrete recommendations for more efficient benchmark design and utilization practices leading to dramatic cost savings with minimal loss of benchmark reliability often reducing computation by x100 or more.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Generating video stories from text prompts is a complex task. In addition to having high visual quality, videos need to realistically adhere to a sequence of text prompts whilst being consistent throughout the frames. Creating a benchmark for video generation requires data annotated over time, which contrasts with the single caption used often in video datasets. To fill this gap, we collect comprehensive human annotations on three existing datasets, and introduce StoryBench: a new, challenging multi-task benchmark to reliably evaluate forthcoming text-to-video models. Our benchmark includes three video generation tasks of increasing difficulty: action execution, where the next action must be generated starting from a conditioning video; story continuation, where a sequence of actions must be executed starting from a conditioning video; and story generation, where a video must be generated from only text prompts. We evaluate small yet strong text-to-video baselines, and show the benefits of training on story-like data algorithmically generated from existing video captions. Finally, we establish guidelines for human evaluation of video stories, and reaffirm the need of better automatic metrics for video generation. StoryBench aims at encouraging future research efforts in this exciting new area.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The introduction of the transformer architecture and the self-attention mechanism has led to an explosive production of language models trained on specific downstream tasks and data domains. With over 200, 000 models in the Hugging Face ecosystem, users grapple with selecting and optimizing models to suit multifaceted workflows and data domains while addressing computational, security, and recency concerns. There is an urgent need for machine learning frameworks that can eliminate the burden of model selection and customization and unleash the incredible power of the vast emerging model library for end users. Here, we propose a context-aware routing system, Tryage, that leverages a language model router for optimal selection of expert models from a model library based on analysis of individual input prompts. Inspired by the thalamic router in the brain, Tryage employs a perceptive router to predict down-stream model performance on prompts and, then, makes a routing decision using an objective function that integrates performance predictions with user goals and constraints that are incorporated through flags (e.g., model size, model recency). Tryage allows users to explore a Pareto front and automatically trade-off between task accuracy and secondary goals including minimization of model size, recency, security, verbosity, and readability. Across heterogeneous data sets that include code, text, clinical data, and patents, the Tryage framework surpasses Gorilla and GPT3.5 turbo in dynamic model selection identifying the optimal model with an accuracy of 50.9% , compared to 23.6% by GPT 3.5 Turbo and 10.8% by Gorilla. Conceptually, Tryage demonstrates how routing models can be applied to program and control the behavior of multi-model LLM systems to maximize efficient use of the expanding and evolving language model ecosystem.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>What does it take to create the Babel Fish, a tool that can help individuals translate speech between any two languages? While recent breakthroughs in text-based models have pushed machine translation coverage beyond 200 languages, unified speech-to-speech translation models have yet to achieve similar strides. More specifically, conventional speech-to-speech translation systems rely on cascaded systems that perform translation progressively, putting high-performing unified systems out of reach. To address these gaps, we introduce SeamlessM4T, a single model that supports speech-to-speech translation, speech-to-text translation, text-to-speech translation, text-to-text translation, and automatic speech recognition for up to 100 languages. To build this, we used 1 million hours of open speech audio data to learn self-supervised speech representations with w2v-BERT 2.0. Subsequently, we created a multimodal corpus of automatically aligned speech translations. Filtered and combined with human-labeled and pseudo-labeled data, we developed the first multilingual system capable of translating from and into English for both speech and text. On FLEURS, SeamlessM4T sets a new standard for translations into multiple target languages, achieving an improvement of 20% BLEU over the previous SOTA in direct speech-to-text translation. Compared to strong cascaded models, SeamlessM4T improves the quality of into-English translation by 1.3 BLEU points in speech-to-text and by 2.6 ASR-BLEU points in speech-to-speech. Tested for robustness, our system performs better against background noises and speaker variations in speech-to-text tasks compared to the current SOTA model. Critically, we evaluated SeamlessM4T on gender bias and added toxicity to assess translation safety.

<p>Abstract:<br>This study sets out to investigate the feasibility of using ChatGPT to translate citizen-oriented administrative texts into German Easy Language, a simplified, controlled language variety that is adapted to the needs of people with reading impairments. We use ChatGPT to translate selected texts from websites of German public authorities using two strategies, i.e. linguistic and holistic. We analyse the quality of the generated texts based on different criteria, such as correctness, readability, and syntactic complexity. The results indicated that the generated texts are easier than the standard texts, but that they still do not fully meet the established Easy Language standards. Additionally, the content is not always rendered correctly.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Biomedical entity linking (BEL) is the task of grounding entity mentions to a knowledge base. It plays a vital role in information extraction pipelines for the life sciences literature. We review recent work in the field and find that, as the task is absent from existing benchmarks for biomedical text mining, different studies adopt different experimental setups making comparisons based on published numbers problematic. Furthermore, neural systems are tested primarily on instances linked to the broad coverage knowledge base UMLS, leaving their performance to more specialized ones, e.g. genes or variants, understudied. We therefore developed BELB, a Biomedical Entity Linking Benchmark, providing access in a unified format to 11 corpora linked to 7 knowledge bases and spanning six entity types: gene, disease, chemical, species, cell line and variant. BELB greatly reduces preprocessing overhead in testing BEL systems on multiple corpora offering a standardized testbed for reproducible experiments. Using BELB we perform an extensive evaluation of six rule-based entity-specific systems and three recent neural approaches leveraging pre-trained language models. Our results reveal a mixed picture showing that neural approaches fail to perform consistently across entity types, highlighting the need of further studies towards entity-agnostic models.</p>
