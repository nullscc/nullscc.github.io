<p>Abstract:<br>Existing methods of multiple human parsing (MHP) apply statistical models to acquire underlying associations between images and labeled body parts. However, acquired associations often contain many spurious correlations that degrade model generalization, leading statistical models to be vulnerable to visually contextual variations in images (e.g., unseen image styles&#x2F;external interventions). To tackle this, we present a causality inspired parsing paradigm termed CIParsing, which follows fundamental causal principles involving two causal properties for human parsing (i.e., the causal diversity and the causal invariance). Specifically, we assume that an input image is constructed by a mix of causal factors (the characteristics of body parts) and non-causal factors (external contexts), where only the former ones cause the generation process of human parsing.Since causal&#x2F;non-causal factors are unobservable, a human parser in proposed CIParsing is required to construct latent representations of causal factors and learns to enforce representations to satisfy the causal properties. In this way, the human parser is able to rely on causal factors w.r.t relevant evidence rather than non-causal factors w.r.t spurious correlations, thus alleviating model degradation and yielding improved parsing ability. Notably, the CIParsing is designed in a plug-and-play fashion and can be integrated into any existing MHP models. Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Vision Transformer has demonstrated impressive success across various vision tasks. However, its heavy computation cost, which grows quadratically with respect to the token sequence length, largely limits its power in handling large feature maps. To alleviate the computation cost, previous works rely on either fine-grained self-attentions restricted to local small regions, or global self-attentions but to shorten the sequence length resulting in coarse granularity. In this paper, we propose a novel model, termed as Self-guided Transformer~(SG-Former), towards effective global self-attention with adaptive fine granularity. At the heart of our approach is to utilize a significance map, which is estimated through hybrid-scale self-attention and evolves itself during training, to reallocate tokens based on the significance of each region. Intuitively, we assign more tokens to the salient regions for achieving fine-grained attention, while allocating fewer tokens to the minor regions in exchange for efficiency and global receptive fields. The proposed SG-Former achieves performance superior to state of the art: our base size model achieves \textbf{84.7%} Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, \textbf{51.2mAP} bbAP on CoCo, \textbf{52.7mIoU} on ADE20K surpassing the Swin Transformer by \textbf{+1.3% &#x2F; +2.7 mAP&#x2F; +3 mIoU}, with lower computation costs and fewer parameters.

<p>Abstract:<br>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection refers to training the model on an in-distribution (ID) dataset to classify whether the input images come from unknown classes. Considerable effort has been invested in designing various OOD detection methods based on either convolutional neural networks or transformers. However, zero-shot OOD detection methods driven by CLIP, which only require class names for ID, have received less attention. This paper presents a novel method, namely CLIP saying no (CLIPN), which empowers the logic of saying no within CLIP. Our key motivation is to equip CLIP with the capability of distinguishing OOD and ID samples using positive-semantic prompts and negation-semantic prompts. Specifically, we design a novel learnable no prompt and a no text encoder to capture negation semantics within images. Subsequently, we introduce two loss functions: the image-text binary-opposite loss and the text semantic-opposite loss, which we use to teach CLIPN to associate images with no prompts, thereby enabling it to identify unknown samples. Furthermore, we propose two threshold-free inference algorithms to perform OOD detection by utilizing negation semantics from no prompts and the text encoder. Experimental results on 9 benchmark datasets (3 ID datasets and 6 OOD datasets) for the OOD detection task demonstrate that CLIPN, based on ViT-B-16, outperforms 7 well-used algorithms by at least 2.34% and 11.64% in terms of AUROC and FPR95 for zero-shot OOD detection on ImageNet-1K. Our CLIPN can serve as a solid foundation for effectively leveraging CLIP in downstream OOD tasks.

<p>Abstract:<br>Analysis of player movements is a crucial subset of sports analysis. Existing player movement analysis methods use recorded videos after the match is over. In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework for player movement analysis for badminton matches on live broadcast match videos. We only use the visual inputs from the match and, unlike other approaches which use multi-modal sensor data, our approach uses only visual cues. We propose a method to calculate the on-court distance covered by both the players from the video feed of a live broadcast badminton match. To perform this analysis, we focus on the gameplay by removing replays and other redundant parts of the broadcast match. We then perform player tracking to identify and track the movements of both players in each frame. Finally, we calculate the distance covered by each player and the average speed with which they move on the court. We further show a heatmap of the areas covered by the player on the court which is useful for analyzing the gameplay of the player. Our proposed framework was successfully used to analyze live broadcast matches in real-time during the Premier Badminton League 2019 (PBL 2019), with commentators and broadcasters appreciating the utility.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper presents IP-SLT, a simple yet effective framework for sign language translation (SLT). Our IP-SLT adopts a recurrent structure and enhances the semantic representation (prototype) of the input sign language video via an iterative refinement manner. Our idea mimics the behavior of human reading, where a sentence can be digested repeatedly, till reaching accurate understanding. Technically, IP-SLT consists of feature extraction, prototype initialization, and iterative prototype refinement. The initialization module generates the initial prototype based on the visual feature extracted by the feature extraction module. Then, the iterative refinement module leverages the cross-attention mechanism to polish the previous prototype by aggregating it with the original video feature. Through repeated refinement, the prototype finally converges to a more stable and accurate state, leading to a fluent and appropriate translation. In addition, to leverage the sequential dependence of prototypes, we further propose an iterative distillation loss to compress the knowledge of the final iteration into previous ones. As the autoregressive decoding process is executed only once in inference, our IP-SLT is ready to improve various SLT systems with acceptable overhead. Extensive experiments are conducted on public benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the IP-SLT.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The realm of medical image diagnosis has advanced significantly with the integration of computer-aided diagnosis and surgical systems. However, challenges persist, particularly in achieving precise image segmentation. While deep learning techniques show potential, obstacles like limited resources, slow convergence, and class imbalance impede their effectiveness. Traditional patch-based methods, though common, struggle to capture intricate tumor boundaries and often lead to redundant samples, compromising computational efficiency and feature quality. To tackle these issues, this research introduces an innovative approach centered on the tumor itself for patch-based image analysis. This novel tumor-centered patching method aims to address the class imbalance and boundary deficiencies, enabling focused and accurate tumor segmentation. By aligning patches with the tumor’s anatomical context, this technique enhances feature extraction accuracy and reduces computational load. Experimental results demonstrate improved class imbalance, with segmentation scores of 0.78, 0.76, and 0.71 for whole, core, and enhancing tumors, respectively using a lightweight simple U-Net. This approach shows potential for enhancing medical image segmentation and improving computer-aided diagnosis systems.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Non-photorealistic videos are in demand with the wave of the metaverse, but lack of sufficient research studies. This work aims to take a step forward to understand how humans perceive non-photorealistic videos with eye fixation (\ie, saliency detection), which is critical for enhancing media production, artistic design, and game user experience. To fill in the gap of missing a suitable dataset for this research line, we present NPF-200, the first large-scale multi-modal dataset of purely non-photorealistic videos with eye fixations. Our dataset has three characteristics: 1) it contains soundtracks that are essential according to vision and psychological studies; 2) it includes diverse semantic content and videos are of high-quality; 3) it has rich motions across and within videos. We conduct a series of analyses to gain deeper insights into this task and compare several state-of-the-art methods to explore the gap between natural images and non-photorealistic data. Additionally, as the human attention system tends to extract visual and audio features with different frequencies, we propose a universal frequency-aware multi-modal non-photorealistic saliency detection model called NPSNet, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance of our task. The results uncover strengths and weaknesses of multi-modal network design and multi-domain training, opening up promising directions for future works. {Our dataset and code can be found at \url{<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/Yangziyu/NPF200%7D%7D">https://github.com/Yangziyu/NPF200}}</a>.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper discusses the benefits of incorporating multimodal data for improving latent emotion recognition accuracy, focusing on micro-expression (ME) and physiological signals (PS). The proposed approach presents a novel multimodal learning framework that combines ME and PS, including a 1D separable and mixable depthwise inception network, a standardised normal distribution weighted feature fusion method, and depth&#x2F;physiology guided attention modules for multimodal learning. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the benchmark method, with the weighted fusion method and guided attention modules both contributing to enhanced performance.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Membership Inference Attack (MIA) identifies whether a record exists in a machine learning model’s training set by querying the model. MIAs on the classic classification models have been well-studied, and recent works have started to explore how to transplant MIA onto generative models. Our investigation indicates that existing MIAs designed for generative models mainly depend on the overfitting in target models. However, overfitting can be avoided by employing various regularization techniques, whereas existing MIAs demonstrate poor performance in practice. Unlike overfitting, memorization is essential for deep learning models to attain optimal performance, making it a more prevalent phenomenon. Memorization in generative models leads to an increasing trend in the probability distribution of generating records around the member record. Therefore, we propose a Probabilistic Fluctuation Assessing Membership Inference Attack (PFAMI), a black-box MIA that infers memberships by detecting these trends via analyzing the overall probabilistic fluctuations around given records. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple generative models and datasets, which demonstrate PFAMI can improve the attack success rate (ASR) by about 27.9% when compared with the best baseline.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Conflating&#x2F;stitching 2.5D raster digital surface models (DSM) into a large one has been a running practice in geoscience applications, however, conflating full-3D mesh models, such as those from oblique photogrammetry, is extremely challenging. In this letter, we propose a novel approach to address this challenge by conflating multiple full-3D oblique photogrammetric models into a single, and seamless mesh for high-resolution site modeling. Given two or more individually collected and created photogrammetric meshes, we first propose to create a virtual camera field (with a panoramic field of view) to incubate virtual spaces represented by Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF), an implicit volumetric field friendly for linear 3D fusion; then we adaptively leverage the truncated bound of meshes in TSDF to conflate them into a single and accurate full 3D site model. With drone-based 3D meshes, we show that our approach significantly improves upon traditional methods for model conflations, to drive new potentials to create excessively large and accurate full 3D mesh models in support of geoscience and environmental applications.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Many practical systems for image-based surface reconstruction employ a stereo&#x2F;multi-stereo paradigm, due to its ability to scale for large scenes and its ease of implementation for out-of-core operations. In this process, multiple and abundant depth maps from stereo matching must be combined and fused into a single, consistent, and clean point cloud. However, the noises and outliers caused by stereo matching and the heterogenous geometric errors of the poses present a challenge for existing fusion algorithms, since they mostly assume Gaussian errors and predict fused results based on data from local spatial neighborhoods, which may inherit uncertainties from multiple depths resulting in lowered accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel depth fusion paradigm, that instead of numerically fusing points from multiple depth maps, selects the best depth map per point, and combines them into a single and clean point cloud. This paradigm, called select-and-combine (SAC), is achieved through modeling the point level fusion using local Markov Netlets, a micro-network over point across neighboring views for depth&#x2F;view selection, followed by a Netlets collapse process for point combination. The Markov Netlets are optimized such that they can inherently leverage spatial consistencies among depth maps of neighboring views, thus they can address errors beyond Gaussian ones. Our experiment results show that our approach outperforms existing depth fusion approaches by increasing the F1 score that considers both accuracy and completeness by 2.07% compared to the best existing method. Finally, our approach generates clearer point clouds that are 18% less redundant while with a higher accuracy before fusion</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Facial landmark detection is an essential technology for driver status tracking and has been in demand for real-time estimations. As a landmark coordinate prediction, heatmap-based methods are known to achieve a high accuracy, and Lite-HRNet can achieve a fast estimation. However, with Lite-HRNet, the problem of a heavy computational cost of the fusion block, which connects feature maps with different resolutions, has yet to be solved. In addition, the strong output module used in HRNetV2 is not applied to Lite-HRNet. Given these problems, we propose a novel architecture called Lite-HRNet Plus. Lite-HRNet Plus achieves two improvements: a novel fusion block based on a channel attention and a novel output module with less computational intensity using multi-resolution feature maps. Through experiments conducted on two facial landmark datasets, we confirmed that Lite-HRNet Plus further improved the accuracy in comparison with conventional methods, and achieved a state-of-the-art accuracy with a computational complexity with the range of 10M FLOPs.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Models for fine-grained image classification tasks, where the difference between some classes can be extremely subtle and the number of samples per class tends to be low, are particularly prone to picking up background-related biases and demand robust methods to handle potential examples with out-of-distribution (OOD) backgrounds. To gain deeper insights into this critical problem, our research investigates the impact of background-induced bias on fine-grained image classification, evaluating standard backbone models such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT). We explore two masking strategies to mitigate background-induced bias: Early masking, which removes background information at the (input) image level, and late masking, which selectively masks high-level spatial features corresponding to the background. Extensive experiments assess the behavior of CNN and ViT models under different masking strategies, with a focus on their generalization to OOD backgrounds. The obtained findings demonstrate that both proposed strategies enhance OOD performance compared to the baseline models, with early masking consistently exhibiting the best OOD performance. Notably, a ViT variant employing GAP-Pooled Patch token-based classification combined with early masking achieves the highest OOD robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Segmenting cells and tracking their motion over time is a common task in biomedical applications. However, predicting accurate instance-wise segmentation and cell motions from microscopy imagery remains a challenging task. Using microstructured environments for analyzing single cells in a constant flow of media adds additional complexity. While large-scale labeled microscopy datasets are available, we are not aware of any large-scale dataset, including both cells and microstructures. In this paper, we introduce the trapped yeast cell (TYC) dataset, a novel dataset for understanding instance-level semantics and motions of cells in microstructures. We release $105$ dense annotated high-resolution brightfield microscopy images, including about $19$k instance masks. We also release $261$ curated video clips composed of $1293$ high-resolution microscopy images to facilitate unsupervised understanding of cell motions and morphology. TYC offers ten times more instance annotations than the previously largest dataset, including cells and microstructures. Our effort also exceeds previous attempts in terms of microstructure variability, resolution, complexity, and capturing device (microscopy) variability. We facilitate a unified comparison on our novel dataset by introducing a standardized evaluation strategy. TYC and evaluation code are publicly available under CC BY 4.0 license.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Group sparsity in Machine Learning (ML) encourages simpler, more interpretable models with fewer active parameter groups. This work aims to incorporate structured group sparsity into the shared parameters of a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework, to develop parsimonious models that can effectively address multiple tasks with fewer parameters while maintaining comparable or superior performance to a dense model. Sparsifying the model during training helps decrease the model’s memory footprint, computation requirements, and prediction time during inference. We use channel-wise l1&#x2F;l2 group sparsity in the shared layers of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This approach not only facilitates the elimination of extraneous groups (channels) but also imposes a penalty on the weights, thereby enhancing the learning of all tasks. We compare the outcomes of single-task and multi-task experiments under group sparsity on two publicly available MTL datasets, NYU-v2 and CelebAMask-HQ. We also investigate how changing the sparsification degree impacts both the performance of the model and the sparsity of groups.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Point cloud has a wide range of applications in areas such as autonomous driving, mapping, navigation, scene reconstruction, and medical imaging. Due to its great potentials in these applications, point cloud processing has gained great attention in the field of computer vision. Among various point cloud processing techniques, deep learning (DL) has become one of the mainstream and effective methods for tasks such as detection, segmentation and classification. To reduce overfitting during training DL models and improve model performance especially when the amount and&#x2F;or diversity of training data are limited, augmentation is often crucial. Although various point cloud data augmentation methods have been widely used in different point cloud processing tasks, there are currently no published systematic surveys or reviews of these methods. Therefore, this article surveys and discusses these methods and categorizes them into a taxonomy framework. Through the comprehensive evaluation and comparison of the augmentation methods, this article identifies their potentials and limitations and suggests possible future research directions. This work helps researchers gain a holistic understanding of the current status of point cloud data augmentation and promotes its wider application and development.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Most of Continual Learning (CL) methods push the limit of supervised learning settings, where an agent is expected to learn new labeled tasks and not forget previous knowledge. However, these settings are not well aligned with real-life scenarios, where a learning agent has access to a vast amount of unlabeled data encompassing both novel (entirely unlabeled) classes and examples from known classes. Drawing inspiration from Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), we introduce a novel framework that relaxes this assumption. Precisely, in any task, we allow for the existence of novel and known classes, and one must use continual version of unsupervised learning methods to discover them. We call this setting Generalized Continual Category Discovery (GCCD). It unifies CL and GCD, bridging the gap between synthetic benchmarks and real-life scenarios. With a series of experiments, we present that existing methods fail to accumulate knowledge from subsequent tasks in which unlabeled samples of novel classes are present. In light of these limitations, we propose a method that incorporates both supervised and unsupervised signals and mitigates the forgetting through the use of centroid adaptation. Our method surpasses strong CL methods adopted for GCD techniques and presents a superior representation learning performance.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) pedestrian detection aims to locate the pedestrians in RGB-T image pairs to exploit the complementation between the two modalities for improving detection robustness in extreme conditions. Most existing algorithms assume that the RGB-T image pairs are well registered, while in the real world they are not aligned ideally due to parallax or different field-of-view of the cameras. The pedestrians in misaligned image pairs may locate at different positions in two images, which results in two challenges: 1) how to achieve inter-modality complementation using spatially misaligned RGB-T pedestrian patches, and 2) how to recognize the unpaired pedestrians at the boundary. To deal with these issues, we propose a new paradigm for unregistered RGB-T pedestrian detection, which predicts two separate pedestrian locations in the RGB and thermal images, respectively. Specifically, we propose a cross-modality proposal-guided feature mining (CPFM) mechanism to extract the two precise fusion features for representing the pedestrian in the two modalities, even if the RGB-T image pair is unaligned. It enables us to effectively exploit the complementation between the two modalities. With the CPFM mechanism, we build a two-stream dense detector; it predicts the two pedestrian locations in the two modalities based on the corresponding fusion feature mined by the CPFM mechanism. Besides, we design a data augmentation method, named Homography, to simulate the discrepancy in scales and views between images. We also investigate two non-maximum suppression (NMS) methods for post-processing. Favorable experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method in dealing with unregistered pedestrians with different shifts.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>MRI super-resolution (SR) and denoising tasks are fundamental challenges in the field of deep learning, which have traditionally been treated as distinct tasks with separate paired training data. In this paper, we propose an innovative method that addresses both tasks simultaneously using a single deep learning model, eliminating the need for explicitly paired noisy and clean images during training. Our proposed model is primarily trained for SR, but also exhibits remarkable noise-cleaning capabilities in the super-resolved images. Instead of conventional approaches that introduce frequency-related operations into the generative process, our novel approach involves the use of a GAN model guided by a frequency-informed discriminator. To achieve this, we harness the power of the 3D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) operation as a frequency constraint within the GAN framework for the SR task on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Specifically, our contributions include: 1) a 3D generator based on residual-in-residual connected blocks; 2) the integration of the 3D DWT with $1\times 1$ convolution into a DWT+conv unit within a 3D Unet for the discriminator; 3) the use of the trained model for high-quality image SR, accompanied by an intrinsic denoising process. We dub the model “Denoising Induced Super-resolution GAN (DISGAN)” due to its dual effects of SR image generation and simultaneous denoising. Departing from the traditional approach of training SR and denoising tasks as separate models, our proposed DISGAN is trained only on the SR task, but also achieves exceptional performance in denoising. The model is trained on 3D MRI data from dozens of subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and further evaluated on previously unseen MRI data from subjects with brain tumours and epilepsy to assess its denoising and SR performance.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Understanding dark scenes based on multi-modal image data is challenging, as both the visible and auxiliary modalities provide limited semantic information for the task. Previous methods focus on fusing the two modalities but neglect the correlations among semantic classes when minimizing losses to align pixels with labels, resulting in inaccurate class predictions. To address these issues, we introduce a supervised multi-modal contrastive learning approach to increase the semantic discriminability of the learned multi-modal feature spaces by jointly performing cross-modal and intra-modal contrast under the supervision of the class correlations. The cross-modal contrast encourages same-class embeddings from across the two modalities to be closer and pushes different-class ones apart. The intra-modal contrast forces same-class or different-class embeddings within each modality to be together or apart. We validate our approach on a variety of tasks that cover diverse light conditions and image modalities. Experiments show that our approach can effectively enhance dark scene understanding based on multi-modal images with limited semantics by shaping semantic-discriminative feature spaces. Comparisons with previous methods demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance.

<p>Abstract:<br>With the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) remarkably improving, DNNs have been widely used in many areas. Consequently, the DNN model has become a valuable asset, and its intellectual property is safeguarded by ownership verification techniques (e.g., DNN fingerprinting). However, the feasibility of the DNN fingerprint removal attack and its potential influence remains an open problem. In this paper, we perform the first comprehensive investigation of DNN fingerprint removal attacks. Generally, the knowledge contained in a DNN model can be categorized into general semantic and fingerprint-specific knowledge. To this end, we propose a min-max bilevel optimization-based DNN fingerprint removal attack named RemovalNet, to evade model ownership verification. The lower-level optimization is designed to remove fingerprint-specific knowledge. While in the upper-level optimization, we distill the victim model’s general semantic knowledge to maintain the surrogate model’s performance. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the fidelity, effectiveness, and efficiency of the RemovalNet against four advanced defense methods on six metrics. The empirical results demonstrate that (1) the RemovalNet is effective. After our DNN fingerprint removal attack, the model distance between the target and surrogate models is x100 times higher than that of the baseline attacks, (2) the RemovalNet is efficient. It uses only 0.2% (400 samples) of the substitute dataset and 1,000 iterations to conduct our attack. Besides, compared with advanced model stealing attacks, the RemovalNet saves nearly 85% of computational resources at most, (3) the RemovalNet achieves high fidelity that the created surrogate model maintains high accuracy after the DNN fingerprint removal process.

<p>Abstract:<br>Multimodal large language models acquire their instruction-following capabilities through a two-stage training process: pre-training on image-text pairs and fine-tuning on supervised vision-language instruction data. Recent studies have shown that large language models can achieve satisfactory results even with a limited amount of high-quality instruction-following data. In this paper, we introduce InstructionGPT-4, which is fine-tuned on a small dataset comprising only 200 examples, amounting to approximately 6% of the instruction-following data used in the alignment dataset for MiniGPT-4. We first propose several metrics to access the quality of multimodal instruction data. Based on these metrics, we present a simple and effective data selector to automatically identify and filter low-quality vision-language data. By employing this method, InstructionGPT-4 outperforms the original MiniGPT-4 on various evaluations (e.g., visual question answering, GPT-4 preference). Overall, our findings demonstrate that less but high-quality instruction tuning data is efficient to enable multimodal large language models to generate better output.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Existing shadow detection datasets often contain missing or mislabeled shadows, which can hinder the performance of deep learning models trained directly on such data. To address this issue, we propose SILT, the Shadow-aware Iterative Label Tuning framework, which explicitly considers noise in shadow labels and trains the deep model in a self-training manner. Specifically, we incorporate strong data augmentations with shadow counterfeiting to help the network better recognize non-shadow regions and alleviate overfitting. We also devise a simple yet effective label tuning strategy with global-local fusion and shadow-aware filtering to encourage the network to make significant refinements on the noisy labels. We evaluate the performance of SILT by relabeling the test set of the SBU dataset and conducting various experiments. Our results show that even a simple U-Net trained with SILT can outperform all state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. When trained on SBU &#x2F; UCF &#x2F; ISTD, our network can successfully reduce the Balanced Error Rate by 25.2% &#x2F; 36.9% &#x2F; 21.3% over the best state-of-the-art method.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Small farms contribute to a large share of the productive land in developing countries. In regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, where 80% of farms are small (under 2 ha in size), the task of mapping smallholder cropland is an important part of tracking sustainability measures such as crop productivity. However, the visually diverse and nuanced appearance of small farms has limited the effectiveness of traditional approaches to cropland mapping. Here we introduce a new approach based on the detection of harvest piles characteristic of many smallholder systems throughout the world. We present HarvestNet, a dataset for mapping the presence of farms in the Ethiopian regions of Tigray and Amhara during 2020-2023, collected using expert knowledge and satellite images, totaling 7k hand-labeled images and 2k ground collected labels. We also benchmark a set of baselines including SOTA models in remote sensing with our best models having around 80% classification performance on hand labelled data and 90%, 98% accuracy on ground truth data for Tigray, Amhara respectively. We also perform a visual comparison with a widely used pre-existing coverage map and show that our model detects an extra 56,621 hectares of cropland in Tigray. We conclude that remote sensing of harvest piles can contribute to more timely and accurate cropland assessments in food insecure region.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Generative text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion allow users to generate images based on a textual description, the prompt. Changing the prompt is still the primary means for the user to change a generated image as desired. However, changing the image by reformulating the prompt remains a difficult process of trial and error, which has led to the emergence of prompt engineering as a new field of research. We propose and analyze methods to change the embedding of a prompt directly instead of the prompt text. It allows for more fine-grained and targeted control that takes into account user intentions. Our approach treats the generative text-to-image model as a continuous function and passes gradients between the image space and the prompt embedding space. By addressing different user interaction problems, we can apply this idea in three scenarios: (1) Optimization of a metric defined in image space that could measure, for example, image style. (2) Assistance of users in creative tasks by enabling them to navigate the image space along a selection of directions of “near” prompt embeddings. (3) Changing the embedding of the prompt to include information that the user has seen in a particular seed but finds difficult to describe in the prompt. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the described methods.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The visual models pretrained on large-scale benchmarks encode general knowledge and prove effective in building more powerful representations for downstream tasks. Most existing approaches follow the fine-tuning paradigm, either by initializing or regularizing the downstream model based on the pretrained one. The former fails to retain the knowledge in the successive fine-tuning phase, thereby prone to be over-fitting, and the latter imposes strong constraints to the weights or feature maps of the downstream model without considering semantic drift, often incurring insufficient optimization. To deal with these issues, we propose a novel fine-tuning framework, namely distribution regularization with semantic calibration (DR-Tune). It employs distribution regularization by enforcing the downstream task head to decrease its classification error on the pretrained feature distribution, which prevents it from over-fitting while enabling sufficient training of downstream encoders. Furthermore, to alleviate the interference by semantic drift, we develop the semantic calibration (SC) module to align the global shape and class centers of the pretrained and downstream feature distributions. Extensive experiments on widely used image classification datasets show that DR-Tune consistently improves the performance when combing with various backbones under different pretraining strategies.

<p>Abstract:<br>Fall detection is a vital task in health monitoring, as it allows the system to trigger an alert and therefore enabling faster interventions when a person experiences a fall. Although most previous approaches rely on standard RGB video data, such detailed appearance-aware monitoring poses significant privacy concerns. Depth sensors, on the other hand, are better at preserving privacy as they merely capture the distance of objects from the sensor or camera, omitting color and texture information. In this paper, we introduce a privacy-supporting solution that makes the RGB-trained model applicable in depth domain and utilizes depth data at test time for fall detection. To achieve cross-modal fall detection, we present an unsupervised RGB to Depth (RGB2Depth) cross-modal domain adaptation approach that leverages labelled RGB data and unlabelled depth data during training. Our proposed pipeline incorporates an intermediate domain module for feature bridging, modality adversarial loss for modality discrimination, classification loss for pseudo-labeled depth data and labeled source data, triplet loss that considers both source and target domains, and a novel adaptive loss weight adjustment method for improved coordination among various losses. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in the unsupervised RGB2Depth domain adaptation task for fall detection.

<p>Abstract:<br>Scene Graph Generation (SGG) as a critical task in image understanding, facing the challenge of head-biased prediction caused by the long-tail distribution of predicates. However, current unbiased SGG methods can easily prioritize improving the prediction of tail predicates while ignoring the substantial sacrifice in the prediction of head predicates, leading to a shift from head bias to tail bias. To address this issue, we propose a model-agnostic Head-Tail Collaborative Learning (HTCL) network that includes head-prefer and tail-prefer feature representation branches that collaborate to achieve accurate recognition of both head and tail predicates. We also propose a self-supervised learning approach to enhance the prediction ability of the tail-prefer feature representation branch by constraining tail-prefer predicate features. Specifically, self-supervised learning converges head predicate features to their class centers while dispersing tail predicate features as much as possible through contrast learning and head center loss. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our HTCL by applying it to various SGG models on VG150, Open Images V6 and GQA200 datasets. The results show that our method achieves higher mean Recall with a minimal sacrifice in Recall and achieves a new state-of-the-art overall performance.

<p>Abstract:<br>The large-scale visual-language pre-trained model, Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), has significantly improved image captioning for scenarios without human-annotated image-caption pairs. Recent advanced CLIP-based image captioning without human annotations follows a text-only training paradigm, i.e., reconstructing text from shared embedding space. Nevertheless, these approaches are limited by the training&#x2F;inference gap or huge storage requirements for text embeddings. Given that it is trivial to obtain images in the real world, we propose CLIP-guided text GAN (CgT-GAN), which incorporates images into the training process to enable the model to “see” real visual modality. Particularly, we use adversarial training to teach CgT-GAN to mimic the phrases of an external text corpus and CLIP-based reward to provide semantic guidance. The caption generator is jointly rewarded based on the caption naturalness to human language calculated from the GAN’s discriminator and the semantic guidance reward computed by the CLIP-based reward module. In addition to the cosine similarity as the semantic guidance reward (i.e., CLIP-cos), we further introduce a novel semantic guidance reward called CLIP-agg, which aligns the generated caption with a weighted text embedding by attentively aggregating the entire corpus. Experimental results on three subtasks (ZS-IC, In-UIC and Cross-UIC) show that CgT-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly across all metrics.

<p>Abstract:<br>Recently there has been a significant surge in multimodal learning in terms of both image-to-text and text-to-image generation. However, the success is typically limited to English, leaving other languages largely behind. Building a competitive counterpart in other languages is highly challenging due to the low-resource nature of non-English multimodal data (i.e., lack of large-scale, high-quality image-text data). In this work, we propose MPM, an effective training paradigm for training large multimodal models in low-resource languages. MPM demonstrates that Multilingual language models can Pivot zero-shot Multimodal learning across languages. Specifically, based on a strong multilingual large language model, multimodal models pretrained on English-only image-text data can well generalize to other languages in a zero-shot manner for both image-to-text and text-to-image generation, even surpassing models trained on image-text data in native languages. Taking Chinese as a practice of MPM, we build large multimodal models VisCPM in image-to-text and text-to-image generation, which achieve state-of-the-art (open-source) performance in Chinese.

<p>Abstract:<br>Grounding textual expressions on scene objects from first-person views is a truly demanding capability in developing agents that are aware of their surroundings and behave following intuitive text instructions. Such capability is of necessity for glass-devices or autonomous robots to localize referred objects in the real-world. In the conventional referring expression comprehension tasks of images, however, datasets are mostly constructed based on the web-crawled data and don’t reflect diverse real-world structures on the task of grounding textual expressions in diverse objects in the real world. Recently, a massive-scale egocentric video dataset of Ego4D was proposed. Ego4D covers around the world diverse real-world scenes including numerous indoor and outdoor situations such as shopping, cooking, walking, talking, manufacturing, etc. Based on egocentric videos of Ego4D, we constructed a broad coverage of the video-based referring expression comprehension dataset: RefEgo. Our dataset includes more than 12k video clips and 41 hours for video-based referring expression comprehension annotation. In experiments, we combine the state-of-the-art 2D referring expression comprehension models with the object tracking algorithm, achieving the video-wise referred object tracking even in difficult conditions: the referred object becomes out-of-frame in the middle of the video or multiple similar objects are presented in the video.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Large-scale well-annotated datasets are of great importance for training an effective object detector. However, obtaining accurate bounding box annotations is laborious and demanding. Unfortunately, the resultant noisy bounding boxes could cause corrupt supervision signals and thus diminish detection performance. Motivated by the observation that the real ground-truth is usually situated in the aggregation region of the proposals assigned to a noisy ground-truth, we propose DIStribution-aware CalibratiOn (DISCO) to model the spatial distribution of proposals for calibrating supervision signals. In DISCO, spatial distribution modeling is performed to statistically extract the potential locations of objects. Based on the modeled distribution, three distribution-aware techniques, i.e., distribution-aware proposal augmentation (DA-Aug), distribution-aware box refinement (DA-Ref), and distribution-aware confidence estimation (DA-Est), are developed to improve classification, localization, and interpretability, respectively. Extensive experiments on large-scale noisy image datasets (i.e., Pascal VOC and MS-COCO) demonstrate that DISCO can achieve state-of-the-art detection performance, especially at high noise levels.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Time of Flight (ToF) is a prevalent depth sensing technology in the fields of robotics, medical imaging, and non-destructive testing. Yet, ToF sensing faces challenges from complex ambient conditions making an inverse modelling from the sparse temporal information intractable. This paper highlights the potential of modern super-resolution techniques to learn varying surroundings for a reliable and accurate ToF detection. Unlike existing models, we tailor an architecture for sub-sample precise semi-global signal localization by combining super-resolution with an efficient residual contraction block to balance between fine signal details and large scale contextual information. We consolidate research on ToF by conducting a benchmark comparison against six state-of-the-art methods for which we employ two publicly available datasets. This includes the release of our SToF-Chirp dataset captured by an airborne ultrasound transducer. Results showcase the superior performance of our proposed StofNet in terms of precision, reliability and model complexity.

<p>Abstract:<br>RGB-D action and gesture recognition remain an interesting topic in human-centered scene understanding, primarily due to the multiple granularities and large variation in human motion. Although many RGB-D based action and gesture recognition approaches have demonstrated remarkable results by utilizing highly integrated spatio-temporal representations across multiple modalities (i.e., RGB and depth data), they still encounter several challenges. Firstly, vanilla 3D convolution makes it hard to capture fine-grained motion differences between local clips under different modalities. Secondly, the intricate nature of highly integrated spatio-temporal modeling can lead to optimization difficulties. Thirdly, duplicate and unnecessary information can add complexity and complicate entangled spatio-temporal modeling. To address the above issues, we propose an innovative heuristic architecture called Multi-stage Factorized Spatio-Temporal (MFST) for RGB-D action and gesture recognition. The proposed MFST model comprises a 3D Central Difference Convolution Stem (CDC-Stem) module and multiple factorized spatio-temporal stages. The CDC-Stem enriches fine-grained temporal perception, and the multiple hierarchical spatio-temporal stages construct dimension-independent higher-order semantic primitives. Specifically, the CDC-Stem module captures bottom-level spatio-temporal features and passes them successively to the following spatio-temporal factored stages to capture the hierarchical spatial and temporal features through the Multi- Scale Convolution and Transformer (MSC-Trans) hybrid block and Weight-shared Multi-Scale Transformer (WMS-Trans) block. The seamless integration of these innovative designs results in a robust spatio-temporal representation that outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on RGB-D action and gesture recognition datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Image Quality Assessment (IQA) constitutes a fundamental task within the field of computer vision, yet it remains an unresolved challenge, owing to the intricate distortion conditions, diverse image contents, and limited availability of data. Recently, the community has witnessed the emergence of numerous large-scale pretrained foundation models, which greatly benefit from dramatically increased data and parameter capacities. However, it remains an open problem whether the scaling law in high-level tasks is also applicable to IQA task which is closely related to low-level clues. In this paper, we demonstrate that with proper injection of local distortion features, a larger pretrained and fixed foundation model performs better in IQA tasks. Specifically, for the lack of local distortion structure and inductive bias of vision transformer (ViT), alongside the large-scale pretrained ViT, we use another pretrained convolution neural network (CNN), which is well known for capturing the local structure, to extract multi-scale image features. Further, we propose a local distortion extractor to obtain local distortion features from the pretrained CNN and a local distortion injector to inject the local distortion features into ViT. By only training the extractor and injector, our method can benefit from the rich knowledge in the powerful foundation models and achieve state-of-the-art performance on popular IQA datasets, indicating that IQA is not only a low-level problem but also benefits from stronger high-level features drawn from large-scale pretrained models.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Text-Pedestrian Image Retrieval aims to use the text describing pedestrian appearance to retrieve the corresponding pedestrian image. This task involves not only modality discrepancy, but also the challenge of the textual diversity of pedestrians with the same identity. At present, although existing research progress has been made in text-pedestrian image retrieval, these methods do not comprehensively consider the above-mentioned problems. Considering these, this paper proposes a progressive feature mining and external knowledge-assisted feature purification method. Specifically, we use a progressive mining mode to enable the model to mine discriminative features from neglected information, thereby avoiding the loss of discriminative information and improving the expression ability of features. In addition, to further reduce the negative impact of modal discrepancy and text diversity on cross-modal matching, we propose to use other sample knowledge of the same modality, i.e., external knowledge to enhance identity-consistent features and weaken identity-inconsistent features. This process purifies features and alleviates the interference caused by textual diversity and negative sample correlation features of the same modal. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, and the retrieval performance even surpasses that of the large-scale model-based method on large-scale datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Network calibration aims to accurately estimate the level of confidences, which is particularly important for employing deep neural networks in real-world systems. Recent approaches leverage mixup to calibrate the network’s predictions during training. However, they do not consider the problem that mixtures of labels in mixup may not accurately represent the actual distribution of augmented samples. In this paper, we present RankMixup, a novel mixup-based framework alleviating the problem of the mixture of labels for network calibration. To this end, we propose to use an ordinal ranking relationship between raw and mixup-augmented samples as an alternative supervisory signal to the label mixtures for network calibration. We hypothesize that the network should estimate a higher level of confidence for the raw samples than the augmented ones (Fig.1). To implement this idea, we introduce a mixup-based ranking loss (MRL) that encourages lower confidences for augmented samples compared to raw ones, maintaining the ranking relationship. We also propose to leverage the ranking relationship among multiple mixup-augmented samples to further improve the calibration capability. Augmented samples with larger mixing coefficients are expected to have higher confidences and vice versa (Fig.1). That is, the order of confidences should be aligned with that of mixing coefficients. To this end, we introduce a novel loss, M-NDCG, in order to reduce the number of misaligned pairs of the coefficients and confidences. Extensive experimental results on standard benchmarks for network calibration demonstrate the effectiveness of RankMixup.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Multi-modal systems have the capacity of producing more reliable results than systems with a single modality in road detection due to perceiving different aspects of the scene. We focus on using raw sensor inputs instead of, as it is typically done in many SOTA works, leveraging architectures that require high pre-processing costs such as surface normals or dense depth predictions. By using raw sensor inputs, we aim to utilize a low-cost model thatminimizes both the pre-processing andmodel computation costs. This study presents a cost-effective and highly accurate solution for road segmentation by integrating data from multiple sensorswithin a multi-task learning architecture.Afusion architecture is proposed in which RGB and LiDAR depth images constitute the inputs of the network. Another contribution of this study is to use IMU&#x2F;GNSS (inertial measurement unit&#x2F;global navigation satellite system) inertial navigation system whose data is collected synchronously and calibrated with a LiDAR-camera to compute aggregated dense LiDAR depth images. It has been demonstrated by experiments on the KITTI dataset that the proposed method offers fast and high-performance solutions. We have also shown the performance of our method on Cityscapes where raw LiDAR data is not available. The segmentation results obtained for both full and half resolution images are competitive with existing methods. Therefore, we conclude that our method is not dependent only on raw LiDAR data; rather, it can be used with different sensor modalities. The inference times obtained in all experiments are very promising for real-time experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Real-world point clouds usually suffer from incompleteness and display different poses. While current point cloud completion methods excel in reproducing complete point clouds with consistent poses as seen in the training set, their performance tends to be unsatisfactory when handling point clouds with diverse poses. We propose a network named Rotation-Invariant Completion Network (RICNet), which consists of two parts: a Dual Pipeline Completion Network (DPCNet) and an enhancing module. Firstly, DPCNet generates a coarse complete point cloud. The feature extraction module of DPCNet can extract consistent features, no matter if the input point cloud has undergone rotation or translation. Subsequently, the enhancing module refines the fine-grained details of the final generated point cloud. RICNet achieves better rotation invariance in feature extraction and incorporates structural relationships in man-made objects. To assess the performance of RICNet and existing methods on point clouds with various poses, we applied random transformations to the point clouds in the MVP dataset and conducted experiments on them. Our experiments demonstrate that RICNet exhibits superior completion performance compared to existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Text-driven localized editing of 3D objects is particularly difficult as locally mixing the original 3D object with the intended new object and style effects without distorting the object’s form is not a straightforward process. To address this issue, we propose a novel NeRF-based model, Blending-NeRF, which consists of two NeRF networks: pretrained NeRF and editable NeRF. Additionally, we introduce new blending operations that allow Blending-NeRF to properly edit target regions which are localized by text. By using a pretrained vision-language aligned model, CLIP, we guide Blending-NeRF to add new objects with varying colors and densities, modify textures, and remove parts of the original object. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Blending-NeRF produces naturally and locally edited 3D objects from various text prompts.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Building scalable vision-language models to learn from diverse, multimodal data remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce an Efficient Vision-languagE foundation model, namely EVE, which is one unified multimodal Transformer pre-trained solely by one unified pre-training task. Specifically, EVE encodes both vision and language within a shared Transformer network integrated with modality-aware sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) modules, which capture modality-specific information by selectively switching to different experts. To unify pre-training tasks of vision and language, EVE performs masked signal modeling on image-text pairs to reconstruct masked signals, i.e., image pixels and text tokens, given visible signals. This simple yet effective pre-training objective accelerates training by 3.5x compared to the model pre-trained with Image-Text Contrastive and Image-Text Matching losses. Owing to the combination of the unified architecture and pre-training task, EVE is easy to scale up, enabling better downstream performance with fewer resources and faster training speed. Despite its simplicity, EVE achieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language downstream tasks, including visual question answering, visual reasoning, and image-text retrieval.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The burden of liver tumors is important, ranking as the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality. In case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the delineation of liver and tumor on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) is performed to guide the treatment strategy. As this task is time-consuming, needs high expertise and could be subject to inter-observer variability there is a strong need for automatic tools. However, challenges arise from the lack of available training data, as well as the high variability in terms of image resolution and MRI sequence. In this work we propose to compare two different pipelines based on anisotropic models to obtain the segmentation of the liver and tumors. The first pipeline corresponds to a baseline multi-class model that performs the simultaneous segmentation of the liver and tumor classes. In the second approach, we train two distinct binary models, one segmenting the liver only and the other the tumors. Our results show that both pipelines exhibit different strengths and weaknesses. Moreover we propose an uncertainty quantification strategy allowing the identification of potential false positive tumor lesions. Both solutions were submitted to the MICCAI 2023 Atlas challenge regarding liver and tumor segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>It is now possible to reconstruct dynamic human motion and shape from a sparse set of cameras using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) driven by an underlying skeleton. However, a challenge remains to model the deformation of cloth and skin in relation to skeleton pose. Unlike existing avatar models that are learned implicitly or rely on a proxy surface, our approach is motivated by the observation that different poses necessitate unique frequency assignments. Neglecting this distinction yields noisy artifacts in smooth areas or blurs fine-grained texture and shape details in sharp regions. We develop a two-branch neural network that is adaptive and explicit in the frequency domain. The first branch is a graph neural network that models correlations among body parts locally, taking skeleton pose as input. The second branch combines these correlation features to a set of global frequencies and then modulates the feature encoding. Our experiments demonstrate that our network outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of preserving details and generalization capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Image dehazing is quite challenging in dense-haze scenarios, where quite less original information remains in the hazy image. Though previous methods have made marvelous progress, they still suffer from information loss in content and color in dense-haze scenarios. The recently emerged Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) exhibits strong generation ability, showing potential for solving this problem. However, DDPM fails to consider the physics property of dehazing task, limiting its information completion capacity. In this work, we propose DehazeDDPM: A DDPM-based and physics-aware image dehazing framework that applies to complex hazy scenarios. Specifically, DehazeDDPM works in two stages. The former stage physically models the dehazing task with the Atmospheric Scattering Model (ASM), pulling the distribution closer to the clear data and endowing DehazeDDPM with fog-aware ability. The latter stage exploits the strong generation ability of DDPM to compensate for the haze-induced huge information loss, by working in conjunction with the physical modelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world hazy datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have demonstrated substantial promise in image generation tasks but heavily rely on the availability of large amounts of training data. Previous works, like GANs, have tackled the limited data problem by transferring pre-trained models learned with sufficient data. However, those methods are hard to be utilized in DPMs since the distinct differences between DPM-based and GAN-based methods, showing in the unique iterative denoising process integral and the need for many timesteps with no-targeted noise in DPMs. In this paper, we propose a novel DPMs-based transfer learning method, TAN, to address the limited data problem. It includes two strategies: similarity-guided training, which boosts transfer with a classifier, and adversarial noise selection which adaptive chooses targeted noise based on the input image. Extensive experiments in the context of few-shot image generation tasks demonstrate that our method is not only efficient but also excels in terms of image quality and diversity when compared to existing GAN-based and DDPM-based methods.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Dancing with music is always an essential human art form to express emotion. Due to the high temporal-spacial complexity, long-term 3D realist dance generation synchronized with music is challenging. Existing methods suffer from the freezing problem when generating long-term dances due to error accumulation and training-inference discrepancy. To address this, we design a conditional diffusion model, LongDanceDiff, for this sequence-to-sequence long-term dance generation, addressing the challenges of temporal coherency and spatial constraint. LongDanceDiff contains a transformer-based diffusion model, where the input is a concatenation of music, past motions, and noised future motions. This partial noising strategy leverages the full-attention mechanism and learns the dependencies among music and past motions. To enhance the diversity of generated dance motions and mitigate the freezing problem, we introduce a mutual information minimization objective that regularizes the dependency between past and future motions. We also address common visual quality issues in dance generation, such as foot sliding and unsmooth motion, by incorporating spatial constraints through a Global-Trajectory Modulation (GTM) layer and motion perceptual losses, thereby improving the smoothness and naturalness of motion generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in our approach over the existing state-of-the-art methods. We plan to release our codes and models soon.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have been shown to generate high-quality images without the need for delicate adversarial training. However, the current sampling process in DPMs is prone to violent shaking. In this paper, we present a novel reverse sampler for DPMs inspired by the widely-used Adam optimizer. Our proposed sampler can be readily applied to a pre-trained diffusion model, utilizing momentum mechanisms and adaptive updating to smooth the reverse sampling process and ensure stable generation, resulting in outputs of enhanced quality. By implicitly reusing update directions from early steps, our proposed sampler achieves a better balance between high-level semantics and low-level details. Additionally, this sampler is flexible and can be easily integrated into pre-trained DPMs regardless of the sampler used during training. Our experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed reverse sampler yields remarkable improvements over different baselines. We will make the source code available.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recognizing target objects using an event-based camera draws more and more attention in recent years. Existing works usually represent the event streams into point-cloud, voxel, image, etc, and learn the feature representations using various deep neural networks. Their final results may be limited by the following factors: monotonous modal expressions and the design of the network structure. To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper proposes a novel dual-stream framework for event representation, extraction, and fusion. This framework simultaneously models two common representations: event images and event voxels. By utilizing Transformer and Structured Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures, spatial information and three-dimensional stereo information can be learned separately. Additionally, a bottleneck Transformer is introduced to facilitate the fusion of the dual-stream information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely used event-based classification datasets.

<p>Abstract:<br>Visual restoration of underwater scenes is crucial for visual tasks, and avoiding interference from underwater media has become a prominent concern. In this work, we present a synergistic multiscale detail refinement via intrinsic supervision (SMDR-IS) to recover underwater scene details. The low-degradation stage provides multiscale detail for original stage, which achieves synergistic multiscale detail refinement through feature propagation via the adaptive selective intrinsic supervised feature module (ASISF), which achieves synergistic multiscale detail refinement. ASISF is developed using intrinsic supervision to precisely control and guide feature transmission in the multi-degradation stages. ASISF improves the multiscale detail refinement while reducing interference from irrelevant scene information from the low-degradation stage. Additionally, within the multi-degradation encoder-decoder of SMDR-IS, we introduce a bifocal intrinsic-context attention module (BICA). This module is designed to effectively leverage multi-scale scene information found in images, using intrinsic supervision principles as its foundation. BICA facilitates the guidance of higher-resolution spaces by leveraging lower-resolution spaces, considering the significant dependency of underwater image restoration on spatial contextual relationships. During the training process, the network gains advantages from the integration of a multi-degradation loss function. This function serves as a constraint, enabling the network to effectively exploit information across various scales. When compared with state-of-the-art methods, SMDR-IS demonstrates its outstanding performance. Code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In this work, we seek to predict camera poses across scenes with a multi-task learning manner, where we view the localization of each scene as a new task. We propose OFVL-MS, a unified framework that dispenses with the traditional practice of training a model for each individual scene and relieves gradient conflict induced by optimizing multiple scenes collectively, enabling efficient storage yet precise visual localization for all scenes. Technically, in the forward pass of OFVL-MS, we design a layer-adaptive sharing policy with a learnable score for each layer to automatically determine whether the layer is shared or not. Such sharing policy empowers us to acquire task-shared parameters for a reduction of storage cost and task-specific parameters for learning scene-related features to alleviate gradient conflict. In the backward pass of OFVL-MS, we introduce a gradient normalization algorithm that homogenizes the gradient magnitude of the task-shared parameters so that all tasks converge at the same pace. Furthermore, a sparse penalty loss is applied on the learnable scores to facilitate parameter sharing for all tasks without performance degradation. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and our new released indoor dataset LIVL, showing that OFVL-MS families significantly outperform the state-of-the-arts with fewer parameters. We also verify that OFVL-MS can generalize to a new scene with much few parameters while gaining superior localization performance.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The dynamics of biomolecules are crucial for our understanding of their functioning in living systems. However, current 3D imaging techniques, such as cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), require freezing the sample, which limits the observation of their conformational changes in real time. The innovative liquid-phase electron microscopy (liquid-phase EM) technique allows molecules to be placed in the native liquid environment, providing a unique opportunity to observe their dynamics. In this paper, we propose TEMPOR, a Temporal Electron MicroscoPy Object Reconstruction algorithm for liquid-phase EM that leverages an implicit neural representation (INR) and a dynamical variational auto-encoder (DVAE) to recover time series of molecular structures. We demonstrate its advantages in recovering different motion dynamics from two simulated datasets, 7bcq and Cas9. To our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to directly recover 3D structures of a temporally-varying particle from liquid-phase EM movies. It provides a promising new approach for studying molecules’ 3D dynamics in structural biology.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Detecting small scene text instances in the wild is particularly challenging, where the influence of irregular positions and nonideal lighting often leads to detection errors. We present MixNet, a hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of CNNs and Transformers, capable of accurately detecting small text from challenging natural scenes, regardless of the orientations, styles, and lighting conditions. MixNet incorporates two key modules: (1) the Feature Shuffle Network (FSNet) to serve as the backbone and (2) the Central Transformer Block (CTBlock) to exploit the 1D manifold constraint of the scene text. We first introduce a novel feature shuffling strategy in FSNet to facilitate the exchange of features across multiple scales, generating high-resolution features superior to popular ResNet and HRNet. The FSNet backbone has achieved significant improvements over many existing text detection methods, including PAN, DB, and FAST. Then we design a complementary CTBlock to leverage center line based features similar to the medial axis of text regions and show that it can outperform contour-based approaches in challenging cases when small scene texts appear closely. Extensive experimental results show that MixNet, which mixes FSNet with CTBlock, achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple scene text detection datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Interpretability is a crucial factor in building reliable models for various medical applications. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enable interpretable image classification by utilizing human-understandable concepts as intermediate targets. Unlike conventional methods that require extensive human labor to construct the concept set, recent works leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating concepts made automatic concept generation possible. However, those methods do not consider whether a concept is visually relevant or not, which is an important factor in computing meaningful concept scores. Therefore, we propose a visual activation score that measures whether the concept contains visual cues or not, which can be easily computed with unlabeled image data. Computed visual activation scores are then used to filter out the less visible concepts, thus resulting in a final concept set with visually meaningful concepts. Our experimental results show that adopting the proposed visual activation score for concept filtering consistently boosts performance compared to the baseline. Moreover, qualitative analyses also validate that visually relevant concepts are successfully selected with the visual activation score.</p>

AMSP-UOD specifically addresses the impact of non-ideal imaging factors on detection accuracy in complex underwater environments. To mitigate the influence of noise on object detection performance, we propose AMSP Vortex Convolution (AMSP-VConv) to disrupt the noise distribution, enhance feature extraction capabilities, effectively reduce parameters, and improve network robustness. We design the Feature Association Decoupling Cross Stage Partial (FAD-CSP) module, which strengthens the association of long and short-range features, improving the network performance in complex underwater environments. Additionally, our sophisticated post-processing method, based on non-maximum suppression with aspect-ratio similarity thresholds, optimizes detection in dense scenes, such as waterweed and schools of fish, improving object detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the URPC and RUOD datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and noise immunity. AMSP-UOD proposes an innovative solution with the potential for real-world applications. Code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We address a challenging lifelong few-shot image generation task for the first time. In this situation, a generative model learns a sequence of tasks using only a few samples per task. Consequently, the learned model encounters both catastrophic forgetting and overfitting problems at a time. Existing studies on lifelong GANs have proposed modulation-based methods to prevent catastrophic forgetting. However, they require considerable additional parameters and cannot generate high-fidelity and diverse images from limited data. On the other hand, the existing few-shot GANs suffer from severe catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks. To alleviate these issues, we propose a framework called Lifelong Few-Shot GAN (LFS-GAN) that can generate high-quality and diverse images in lifelong few-shot image generation task. Our proposed framework learns each task using an efficient task-specific modulator - Learnable Factorized Tensor (LeFT). LeFT is rank-constrained and has a rich representation ability due to its unique reconstruction technique. Furthermore, we propose a novel mode seeking loss to improve the diversity of our model in low-data circumstances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed LFS-GAN can generate high-fidelity and diverse images without any forgetting and mode collapse in various domains, achieving state-of-the-art in lifelong few-shot image generation task. Surprisingly, we find that our LFS-GAN even outperforms the existing few-shot GANs in the few-shot image generation task. The code is available at Github.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Learning implicit templates as neural fields has recently shown impressive performance in unsupervised shape correspondence. Despite the success, we observe current approaches, which solely rely on geometric information, often learn suboptimal deformation across generic object shapes, which have high structural variability. In this paper, we highlight the importance of part deformation consistency and propose a semantic-aware implicit template learning framework to enable semantically plausible deformation. By leveraging semantic prior from a self-supervised feature extractor, we suggest local conditioning with novel semantic-aware deformation code and deformation consistency regularizations regarding part deformation, global deformation, and global scaling. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over baselines in various tasks: keypoint transfer, part label transfer, and texture transfer. More interestingly, our framework shows a larger performance gain under more challenging settings. We also provide qualitative analyses to validate the effectiveness of semantic-aware deformation.

<p>Abstract:<br>We address the problem of network calibration adjusting miscalibrated confidences of deep neural networks. Many approaches to network calibration adopt a regularization-based method that exploits a regularization term to smooth the miscalibrated confidences. Although these approaches have shown the effectiveness on calibrating the networks, there is still a lack of understanding on the underlying principles of regularization in terms of network calibration. We present in this paper an in-depth analysis of existing regularization-based methods, providing a better understanding on how they affect to network calibration. Specifically, we have observed that 1) the regularization-based methods can be interpreted as variants of label smoothing, and 2) they do not always behave desirably. Based on the analysis, we introduce a novel loss function, dubbed ACLS, that unifies the merits of existing regularization methods, while avoiding the limitations. We show extensive experimental results for image classification and semantic segmentation on standard benchmarks, including CIFAR10, Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet, and PASCAL VOC, demonstrating the effectiveness of our loss function.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) can capture non-Euclidean spatial dependence between different brain regions, and the graph pooling operator in GCNs is key to enhancing the representation learning capability and acquiring abnormal brain maps. However, the majority of existing research designs graph pooling operators only from the perspective of nodes while disregarding the original edge features, in a way that not only confines graph pooling application scenarios, but also diminishes its ability to capture critical substructures. In this study, a clustering graph pooling method that first supports multidimensional edge features, called Edge-aware hard clustering graph pooling (EHCPool), is developed. EHCPool proposes the first ‘Edge-to-node’ score evaluation criterion based on edge features to assess node feature significance. To more effectively capture the critical subgraphs, a novel Iteration n-top strategy is further designed to adaptively learn sparse hard clustering assignments for graphs. Subsequently, an innovative N-E Aggregation strategy is presented to aggregate node and edge feature information in each independent subgraph. The proposed model was evaluated on multi-site brain imaging public datasets and yielded state-of-the-art performance. We believe this method is the first deep learning tool with the potential to probe different types of abnormal functional brain networks from data-driven perspective.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Studies on semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) have seen fast progress recently. Due to the limited labelled data, SSMIS methods mainly focus on effectively leveraging unlabeled data to enhance the segmentation performance. However, despite their promising performance, current state-of-the-art methods often prioritize integrating complex techniques and loss terms rather than addressing the core challenges of semi-supervised scenarios directly. We argue that the key to SSMIS lies in generating substantial and appropriate prediction disagreement on unlabeled data. To this end, we emphasize the crutiality of data perturbation and model stabilization in semi-supervised segmentation, and propose a simple yet effective approach to boost SSMIS performance significantly, dubbed DPMS. Specifically, we first revisit SSMIS from three distinct perspectives: the data, the model, and the loss, and conduct a comprehensive study of corresponding strategies to examine their effectiveness. Based on these examinations, we then propose DPMS, which adopts a plain teacher-student framework with a standard supervised loss and unsupervised consistency loss. To produce appropriate prediction disagreements, DPMS perturbs the unlabeled data via strong augmentations to enlarge prediction disagreements considerably. On the other hand, using EMA teacher when strong augmentation is applied does not necessarily improve performance. DPMS further utilizes a forwarding-twice and momentum updating strategies for normalization statistics to stabilize the training on unlabeled data effectively. Despite its simplicity, DPMS can obtain new state-of-the-art performance on the public 2D ACDC and 3D LA datasets across various semi-supervised settings, e.g. obtaining a remarkable 22.62% improvement against previous SOTA on ACDC with 5% labels.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We present a novel unsupervised domain adaption method for person re-identification (reID) that generalizes a model trained on a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. We introduce a camera-driven curriculum learning (CaCL) framework that leverages camera labels of person images to transfer knowledge from source to target domains progressively. To this end, we divide target domain dataset into multiple subsets based on the camera labels, and initially train our model with a single subset (i.e., images captured by a single camera). We then gradually exploit more subsets for training, according to a curriculum sequence obtained with a camera-driven scheduling rule. The scheduler considers maximum mean discrepancies (MMD) between each subset and the source domain dataset, such that the subset closer to the source domain is exploited earlier within the curriculum. For each curriculum sequence, we generate pseudo labels of person images in a target domain to train a reID model in a supervised way. We have observed that the pseudo labels are highly biased toward cameras, suggesting that person images obtained from the same camera are likely to have the same pseudo labels, even for different IDs. To address the camera bias problem, we also introduce a camera-diversity (CD) loss encouraging person images of the same pseudo label, but captured across various cameras, to involve more for discriminative feature learning, providing person representations robust to inter-camera variations. Experimental results on standard benchmarks, including real-to-real and synthetic-to-real scenarios, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Biometric applications, such as person re-identification (ReID), are often deployed on energy constrained devices. While recent ReID methods prioritize high retrieval performance, they often come with large computational costs and high search time, rendering them less practical in real-world settings. In this work, we propose an input-adaptive network with multiple exit blocks, that can terminate computation early if the retrieval is straightforward or noisy, saving a lot of computation. To assess the complexity of the input, we introduce a temporal-based classifier driven by a new training strategy. Furthermore, we adopt a binary hash code generation approach instead of relying on continuous-valued features, which significantly improves the search process by a factor of 20. To ensure similarity preservation, we utilize a new ranking regularizer that bridges the gap between continuous and binary features. Extensive analysis of our proposed method is conducted on three datasets: Market1501, MSMT17 (Multi-Scene Multi-Time), and the BGC1 (BRIAR Government Collection). Using our approach, more than 70% of the samples with compact hash codes exit early on the Market1501 dataset, saving 80% of the networks computational cost and improving over other hash-based methods by 60%. These results demonstrate a significant improvement over dynamic networks and showcase comparable accuracy performance to conventional ReID methods. Code will be made available.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>One-class classification (OCC) is a longstanding method for anomaly detection. With the powerful representation capability of the pre-trained backbone, OCC methods have witnessed significant performance improvements. Typically, most of these OCC methods employ transfer learning to enhance the discriminative nature of the pre-trained backbone’s features, thus achieving remarkable efficacy. While most current approaches emphasize feature transfer strategies, we argue that the optimization objective space within OCC methods could also be an underlying critical factor influencing performance. In this work, we conducted a thorough investigation into the optimization objective of OCC. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and derivation, we unveil a key insights: any space with the suitable norm can serve as an equivalent substitute for the hypersphere center, without relying on the distribution assumption of training samples. Further, we provide guidelines for determining the feasible domain of norms for the OCC optimization objective. This novel insight sparks a simple and data-agnostic deep one-class classification method. Our method is straightforward, with a single 1x1 convolutional layer as a trainable projector and any space with suitable norm as the optimization objective. Extensive experiments validate the reliability and efficacy of our findings and the corresponding methodology, resulting in state-of-the-art performance in both one-class classification and industrial vision anomaly detection and segmentation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper presents a novel approach for accurately estimating age from face images, which overcomes the challenge of collecting a large dataset of individuals with the same identity at different ages. Instead, we leverage readily available face datasets of different people at different ages and aim to extract age-related features using contrastive learning. Our method emphasizes these relevant features while suppressing identity-related features using a combination of cosine similarity and triplet margin losses. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach by achieving state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets, FG-NET and MORPH-II.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In autonomous driving (AD), accurate perception is indispensable to achieving safe and secure driving. Due to its safety-criticality, the security of AD perception has been widely studied. Among different attacks on AD perception, the physical adversarial object evasion attacks are especially severe. However, we find that all existing literature only evaluates their attack effect at the targeted AI component level but not at the system level, i.e., with the entire system semantics and context such as the full AD pipeline. Thereby, this raises a critical research question: can these existing researches effectively achieve system-level attack effects (e.g., traffic rule violations) in the real-world AD context? In this work, we conduct the first measurement study on whether and how effectively the existing designs can lead to system-level effects, especially for the STOP sign-evasion attacks due to their popularity and severity. Our evaluation results show that all the representative prior works cannot achieve any system-level effects. We observe two design limitations in the prior works: 1) physical model-inconsistent object size distribution in pixel sampling and 2) lack of vehicle plant model and AD system model consideration. Then, we propose SysAdv, a novel system-driven attack design in the AD context and our evaluation results show that the system-level effects can be significantly improved, i.e., the violation rate increases by around 70%.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>3D point cloud visual grounding plays a critical role in 3D scene comprehension, encompassing 3D referring expression comprehension (3DREC) and segmentation (3DRES). We argue that 3DREC and 3DRES should be unified in one framework, which is also a natural progression in the community. To explain, 3DREC can help 3DRES locate the referent, while 3DRES can also facilitate 3DREC via more finegrained language-visual alignment. To achieve this, this paper takes the initiative step to integrate 3DREC and 3DRES into a unified framework, termed 3D Referring Transformer (3DRefTR). Its key idea is to build upon a mature 3DREC model and leverage ready query embeddings and visual tokens from the 3DREC model to construct a dedicated mask branch. Specially, we propose Superpoint Mask Branch, which serves a dual purpose: i) By leveraging the heterogeneous CPU-GPU parallelism, while the GPU is occupied generating visual tokens, the CPU concurrently produces superpoints, equivalently accomplishing the upsampling computation; ii) By harnessing on the inherent association between the superpoints and point cloud, it eliminates the heavy computational overhead on the high-resolution visual features for upsampling. This elegant design enables 3DRefTR to achieve both well-performing 3DRES and 3DREC capacities with only a 6% additional latency compared to the original 3DREC model. Empirical evaluations affirm the superiority of 3DRefTR. Specifically, on the ScanRefer dataset, 3DRefTR surpasses the state-of-the-art 3DRES method by 12.43% in mIoU and improves upon the SOTA 3DREC method by 0.6% <a href="mailto:&#65;&#99;&#x63;&#64;&#48;&#x2e;&#50;&#x35;&#73;&#x6f;&#85;">&#65;&#99;&#x63;&#64;&#48;&#x2e;&#50;&#x35;&#73;&#x6f;&#85;</a>.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Scene understanding using multi-modal data is necessary in many applications, e.g., autonomous navigation. To achieve this in a variety of situations, existing models must be able to adapt to shifting data distributions without arduous data annotation. Current approaches assume that the source data is available during adaptation and that the source consists of paired multi-modal data. Both these assumptions may be problematic for many applications. Source data may not be available due to privacy, security, or economic concerns. Assuming the existence of paired multi-modal data for training also entails significant data collection costs and fails to take advantage of widely available freely distributed pre-trained uni-modal models. In this work, we relax both of these assumptions by addressing the problem of adapting a set of models trained independently on uni-modal data to a target domain consisting of unlabeled multi-modal data, without having access to the original source dataset. Our proposed approach solves this problem through a switching framework which automatically chooses between two complementary methods of cross-modal pseudo-label fusion – agreement filtering and entropy weighting – based on the estimated domain gap. We demonstrate our work on the semantic segmentation problem. Experiments across seven challenging adaptation scenarios verify the efficacy of our approach, achieving results comparable to, and in some cases outperforming, methods which assume access to source data. Our method achieves an improvement in mIoU of up to 12% over competing baselines.

<p>Abstract:<br>The global burden of acute and chronic wounds presents a compelling case for enhancing wound classification methods, a vital step in diagnosing and determining optimal treatments. Recognizing this need, we introduce an innovative multi-modal network based on a deep convolutional neural network for categorizing wounds into four categories: diabetic, pressure, surgical, and venous ulcers. Our multi-modal network uses wound images and their corresponding body locations for more precise classification. A unique aspect of our methodology is incorporating a body map system that facilitates accurate wound location tagging, improving upon traditional wound image classification techniques. A distinctive feature of our approach is the integration of models such as VGG16, ResNet152, and EfficientNet within a novel architecture. This architecture includes elements like spatial and channel-wise Squeeze-and-Excitation modules, Axial Attention, and an Adaptive Gated Multi-Layer Perceptron, providing a robust foundation for classification. Our multi-modal network was trained and evaluated on two distinct datasets comprising relevant images and corresponding location information. Notably, our proposed network outperformed traditional methods, reaching an accuracy range of 74.79% to 100% for Region of Interest (ROI) without location classifications, 73.98% to 100% for ROI with location classifications, and 78.10% to 100% for whole image classifications. This marks a significant enhancement over previously reported performance metrics in the literature. Our results indicate the potential of our multi-modal network as an effective decision-support tool for wound image classification, paving the way for its application in various clinical contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>3D single object tracking with LiDAR points is an important task in the computer vision field. Previous methods usually adopt the matching-based or motion-centric paradigms to estimate the current target status. However, the former is sensitive to the similar distractors and the sparseness of point cloud due to relying on appearance matching, while the latter usually focuses on short-term motion clues (eg. two frames) and ignores the long-term motion pattern of target. To address these issues, we propose a mixed paradigm with two stages, named MTM-Tracker, which combines motion modeling with feature matching into a single network. Specifically, in the first stage, we exploit the continuous historical boxes as motion prior and propose an encoder-decoder structure to locate target coarsely. Then, in the second stage, we introduce a feature interaction module to extract motion-aware features from consecutive point clouds and match them to refine target movement as well as regress other target states. Extensive experiments validate that our paradigm achieves competitive performance on large-scale datasets (70.9% in KITTI and 51.70% in NuScenes).

<p>Abstract:<br>Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) under class distribution mismatch aims to tackle a challenging problem wherein unlabeled data contain lots of unknown categories unseen in the labeled ones. In such mismatch scenarios, traditional SSL suffers severe performance damage due to the harmful invasion of the instances with unknown categories into the target classifier. In this study, by strict mathematical reasoning, we reveal that the SSL error under class distribution mismatch is composed of pseudo-labeling error and invasion error, both of which jointly bound the SSL population risk. To alleviate the SSL error, we propose a robust SSL framework called Weight-Aware Distillation (WAD) that, by weights, selectively transfers knowledge beneficial to the target task from unsupervised contrastive representation to the target classifier. Specifically, WAD captures adaptive weights and high-quality pseudo labels to target instances by exploring point mutual information (PMI) in representation space to maximize the role of unlabeled data and filter unknown categories. Theoretically, we prove that WAD has a tight upper bound of population risk under class distribution mismatch. Experimentally, extensive results demonstrate that WAD outperforms five state-of-the-art SSL approaches and one standard baseline on two benchmark datasets, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, and an artificial cross-dataset.

<p>Abstract:<br>Image generation tasks are traditionally undertaken using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Transformer architectures for feature aggregating and dispatching. Despite the frequent application of convolution and attention structures, these structures are not fundamentally required to solve the problem of instability and the lack of interpretability in image generation. In this paper, we propose a unique image generation process premised on the perspective of converting images into a set of point clouds. In other words, we interpret an image as a set of points. As such, our methodology leverages simple clustering methods named Context Clustering (CoC) to generate images from unordered point sets, which defies the convention of using convolution or attention mechanisms. Hence, we exclusively depend on this clustering technique, combined with the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in a generative model. Furthermore, we implement the integration of a module termed the ‘Point Increaser’ for the model. This module is just an MLP tasked with generating additional points for clustering, which are subsequently integrated within the paradigm of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We introduce this model with the novel structure as the Context Clustering Generative Adversarial Network (CoC-GAN), which offers a distinctive viewpoint in the domain of feature aggregating and dispatching. Empirical evaluations affirm that our CoC-GAN, devoid of convolution and attention mechanisms, exhibits outstanding performance. Its interpretability, endowed by the CoC module, also allows for visualization in our experiments. The promising results underscore the feasibility of our method and thus warrant future investigations of applying Context Clustering to more novel and interpretable image generation.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>With the ever-growing complexity of deep learning models for face recognition, it becomes hard to deploy these systems in real life. Researchers have two options: 1) use smaller models; 2) compress their current models. Since the usage of smaller models might lead to concerning biases, compression gains relevance. However, compressing might be also responsible for an increase in the bias of the final model. We investigate the overall performance, the performance on each ethnicity subgroup and the racial bias of a State-of-the-Art quantization approach when used with synthetic and real data. This analysis provides a few more details on potential benefits of performing quantization with synthetic data, for instance, the reduction of biases on the majority of test scenarios. We tested five distinct architectures and three different training datasets. The models were evaluated on a fourth dataset which was collected to infer and compare the performance of face recognition models on different ethnicity.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Backdoor attack is a major threat to deep learning systems in safety-critical scenarios, which aims to trigger misbehavior of neural network models under attacker-controlled conditions. However, most backdoor attacks have to modify the neural network models through training with poisoned data and&#x2F;or direct model editing, which leads to a common but false belief that backdoor attack can be easily avoided by properly protecting the model. In this paper, we show that backdoor attacks can be achieved without any model modification. Instead of injecting backdoor logic into the training data or the model, we propose to place a carefully-designed patch (namely backdoor patch) in front of the camera, which is fed into the model together with the input images. The patch can be trained to behave normally at most of the time, while producing wrong prediction when the input image contains an attacker-controlled trigger object. Our main techniques include an effective training method to generate the backdoor patch and a digital-physical transformation modeling method to enhance the feasibility of the patch in real deployments. Extensive experiments show that PatchBackdoor can be applied to common deep learning models (VGG, MobileNet, ResNet) with an attack success rate of 93% to 99% on classification tasks. Moreover, we implement PatchBackdoor in real-world scenarios and show that the attack is still threatening.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The multi-modal hashing method is widely used in multimedia retrieval. It can fuse multi-source data to generate binary hash code. However, the current multi-modal methods have the problem of low retrieval accuracy. The reason is that the individual backbone networks have limited feature expression capabilities and are not jointly pre-trained on large-scale unsupervised multi-modal data. To solve this problem, we propose a new baseline CLIP Multi-modal Hashing (CLIPMH) method. It uses CLIP model to extract text and image features, and then fuse to generate hash code. CLIP improves the expressiveness of each modal feature. In this way, it can greatly improve the retrieval performance of multi-modal hashing methods. In comparison to state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised multi-modal hashing methods, experiments reveal that the proposed CLIPMH can significantly enhance performance (Maximum increase of 8.38%). CLIP also has great advantages over the text and visual backbone networks commonly used before.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Spatially dense self-supervised learning is a rapidly growing problem domain with promising applications for unsupervised segmentation and pretraining for dense downstream tasks. Despite the abundance of temporal data in the form of videos, this information-rich source has been largely overlooked. Our paper aims to address this gap by proposing a novel approach that incorporates temporal consistency in dense self-supervised learning. While methods designed solely for images face difficulties in achieving even the same performance on videos, our method improves not only the representation quality for videos-but also images. Our approach, which we call time-tuning, starts from image-pretrained models and fine-tunes them with a novel self-supervised temporal-alignment clustering loss on unlabeled videos. This effectively facilitates the transfer of high-level information from videos to image representations. Time-tuning improves the state-of-the-art by 8-10% for unsupervised semantic segmentation on videos and matches it for images. We believe this method paves the way for further self-supervised scaling by leveraging the abundant availability of videos.

<p>Abstract:<br>Cross-scene generalizable NeRF models, which can directly synthesize novel views of unseen scenes, have become a new spotlight of the NeRF field. Several existing attempts rely on increasingly end-to-end “neuralized” architectures, i.e., replacing scene representation and&#x2F;or rendering modules with performant neural networks such as transformers, and turning novel view synthesis into a feed-forward inference pipeline. While those feedforward “neuralized” architectures still do not fit diverse scenes well out of the box, we propose to bridge them with the powerful Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) idea from large language models (LLMs), which has demonstrated superior generalization ability by balancing between larger overall model capacity and flexible per-instance specialization. Starting from a recent generalizable NeRF architecture called GNT, we first demonstrate that MoE can be neatly plugged in to enhance the model. We further customize a shared permanent expert and a geometry-aware consistency loss to enforce cross-scene consistency and spatial smoothness respectively, which are essential for generalizable view synthesis. Our proposed model, dubbed GNT with Mixture-of-View-Experts (GNT-MOVE), has experimentally shown state-of-the-art results when transferring to unseen scenes, indicating remarkably better cross-scene generalization in both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

<p>Abstract:<br>We present an extensible method for identifying semantic points to reverse engineer (i.e. extract the values of) data charts, particularly those in scientific articles. Our method uses a point proposal network (akin to region proposal networks for object detection) to directly predict the position of points of interest in a chart, and it is readily extensible to multiple chart types and chart elements. We focus on complex bar charts in the scientific literature, on which our model is able to detect salient points with an accuracy of 0.8705 F1 (@1.5-cell max deviation); it achieves 0.9810 F1 on synthetically-generated charts similar to those used in prior works. We also explore training exclusively on synthetic data with novel augmentations, reaching surprisingly competent performance in this way (0.6621 F1) on real charts with widely varying appearance, and we further demonstrate our unchanged method applied directly to synthetic pie charts (0.8343 F1).

<p>Abstract:<br>Absolute camera pose regressors estimate the position and orientation of a camera given the captured image alone. Typically, a convolutional backbone with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head is trained using images and pose labels to embed a single reference scene at a time. Recently, this scheme was extended to learn multiple scenes by replacing the MLP head with a set of fully connected layers. In this work, we propose to learn multi-scene absolute camera pose regression with Transformers, where encoders are used to aggregate activation maps with self-attention and decoders transform latent features and scenes encoding into pose predictions. This allows our model to focus on general features that are informative for localization, while embedding multiple scenes in parallel. We extend our previous MS-Transformer approach \cite{shavit2021learning} by introducing a mixed classification-regression architecture that improves the localization accuracy. Our method is evaluated on commonly benchmark indoor and outdoor datasets and has been shown to exceed both multi-scene and state-of-the-art single-scene absolute pose regressors.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization is a critical ability for deep learning models in many real-world scenarios including healthcare and autonomous vehicles. Recently, different techniques have been proposed to improve OOD generalization. Among these methods, gradient-based regularizers have shown promising performance compared with other competitors. Despite this success, our understanding of the role of Hessian and gradient alignment in domain generalization is still limited. To address this shortcoming, we analyze the role of the classifier’s head Hessian matrix and gradient in domain generalization using recent OOD theory of transferability. Theoretically, we show that spectral norm between the classifier’s head Hessian matrices across domains is an upper bound of the transfer measure, a notion of distance between target and source domains. Furthermore, we analyze all the attributes that get aligned when we encourage similarity between Hessians and gradients. Our analysis explains the success of many regularizers like CORAL, IRM, V-REx, Fish, IGA, and Fishr as they regularize part of the classifier’s head Hessian and&#x2F;or gradient. Finally, we propose two simple yet effective methods to match the classifier’s head Hessians and gradients in an efficient way, based on the Hessian Gradient Product (HGP) and Hutchinson’s method (Hutchinson), and without directly calculating Hessians. We validate the OOD generalization ability of proposed methods in different scenarios, including transferability, severe correlation shift, label shift and diversity shift. Our results show that Hessian alignment methods achieve promising performance on various OOD benchmarks.

<p>Abstract:<br>Depth estimation in surgical video plays a crucial role in many image-guided surgery procedures. However, it is difficult and time consuming to create depth map ground truth datasets in surgical videos due in part to inconsistent brightness and noise in the surgical scene. Therefore, building an accurate and robust self-supervised depth and camera ego-motion estimation system is gaining more attention from the computer vision community. Although several self-supervision methods alleviate the need for ground truth depth maps and poses, they still need known camera intrinsic parameters, which are often missing or not recorded. Moreover, the camera intrinsic prediction methods in existing works depend heavily on the quality of datasets. In this work, we aimed to build a self-supervised depth and ego-motion estimation system which can predict not only accurate depth maps and camera pose, but also camera intrinsic parameters. We proposed a cost-volume-based supervision manner to give the system auxiliary supervision for camera parameters prediction. The experimental results showed that the proposed method improved the accuracy of estimated camera parameters, ego-motion, and depth estimation.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The accurate reconstruction of surgical scenes from surgical videos is critical for various applications, including intraoperative navigation and image-guided robotic surgery automation. However, previous approaches, mainly relying on depth estimation, have limited effectiveness in reconstructing surgical scenes with moving surgical tools. To address this limitation and provide accurate 3D position prediction for surgical tools in all frames, we propose a novel approach called SAMSNeRF that combines Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) techniques. Our approach generates accurate segmentation masks of surgical tools using SAM, which guides the refinement of the dynamic surgical scene reconstruction by NeRF. Our experimental results on public endoscopy surgical videos demonstrate that our approach successfully reconstructs high-fidelity dynamic surgical scenes and accurately reflects the spatial information of surgical tools. Our proposed approach can significantly enhance surgical navigation and automation by providing surgeons with accurate 3D position information of surgical tools during surgery.The source code will be released soon.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper presents a sparse Change-Based Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (CB-ConvLSTM) model for event-based eye tracking, key for next-generation wearable healthcare technology such as AR&#x2F;VR headsets. We leverage the benefits of retina-inspired event cameras, namely their low-latency response and sparse output event stream, over traditional frame-based cameras. Our CB-ConvLSTM architecture efficiently extracts spatio-temporal features for pupil tracking from the event stream, outperforming conventional CNN structures. Utilizing a delta-encoded recurrent path enhancing activation sparsity, CB-ConvLSTM reduces arithmetic operations by approximately 4.7$\times$ without losing accuracy when tested on a \texttt{v2e}-generated event dataset of labeled pupils. This increase in efficiency makes it ideal for real-time eye tracking in resource-constrained devices.

<p>Abstract:<br>Face and person recognition have recently achieved remarkable success under challenging scenarios, such as off-pose and cross-spectrum matching. However, long-range recognition systems are often hindered by atmospheric turbulence, leading to spatially and temporally varying distortions in the image. Current solutions rely on generative models to reconstruct a turbulent-free image, but often preserve photo-realism instead of discriminative features that are essential for recognition. This can be attributed to the lack of large-scale datasets of turbulent and pristine paired images, necessary for optimal reconstruction. To address this issue, we propose a new weakly supervised framework that employs a parameter-efficient self-attention module to generate domain agnostic representations, aligning turbulent and pristine images into a common subspace. Additionally, we introduce a new tilt map estimator that predicts geometric distortions observed in turbulent images. This estimate is used to re-rank gallery matches, resulting in up to 13.86% improvement in rank-1 accuracy. Our method does not require synthesizing turbulent-free images or ground-truth paired images, and requires significantly fewer annotated samples, enabling more practical and rapid utility of increasingly large datasets. We analyze our framework using two datasets – Long-Range Face Identification Dataset (LRFID) and BRIAR Government Collection 1 (BGC1) – achieving enhanced discriminability under varying turbulence and standoff distance.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We aim to train a multi-task model such that users can adjust the desired compute budget and relative importance of task performances after deployment, without retraining. This enables optimizing performance for dynamically varying user needs, without heavy computational overhead to train and save models for various scenarios. To this end, we propose a multi-task model consisting of a shared encoder and task-specific decoders where both encoder and decoder channel widths are slimmable. Our key idea is to control the task importance by varying the capacities of task-specific decoders, while controlling the total computational cost by jointly adjusting the encoder capacity. This improves overall accuracy by allowing a stronger encoder for a given budget, increases control over computational cost, and delivers high-quality slimmed sub-architectures based on user’s constraints. Our training strategy involves a novel ‘Configuration-Invariant Knowledge Distillation’ loss that enforces backbone representations to be invariant under different runtime width configurations to enhance accuracy. Further, we present a simple but effective search algorithm that translates user constraints to runtime width configurations of both the shared encoder and task decoders, for sampling the sub-architectures. The key rule for the search algorithm is to provide a larger computational budget to the higher preferred task decoder, while searching a shared encoder configuration that enhances the overall MTL performance. Various experiments on three multi-task benchmarks (PASCALContext, NYUDv2, and CIFAR100-MTL) with diverse backbone architectures demonstrate the advantage of our approach. For example, our method shows a higher controllability by ~33.5% in the NYUD-v2 dataset over prior methods, while incurring much less compute cost.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Accurately estimating the 3D pose and shape is an essential step towards understanding animal behavior, and can potentially benefit many downstream applications, such as wildlife conservation. However, research in this area is held back by the lack of a comprehensive and diverse dataset with high-quality 3D pose and shape annotations. In this paper, we propose Animal3D, the first comprehensive dataset for mammal animal 3D pose and shape estimation. Animal3D consists of 3379 images collected from 40 mammal species, high-quality annotations of 26 keypoints, and importantly the pose and shape parameters of the SMAL model. All annotations were labeled and checked manually in a multi-stage process to ensure highest quality results. Based on the Animal3D dataset, we benchmark representative shape and pose estimation models at: (1) supervised learning from only the Animal3D data, (2) synthetic to real transfer from synthetically generated images, and (3) fine-tuning human pose and shape estimation models. Our experimental results demonstrate that predicting the 3D shape and pose of animals across species remains a very challenging task, despite significant advances in human pose estimation. Our results further demonstrate that synthetic pre-training is a viable strategy to boost the model performance. Overall, Animal3D opens new directions for facilitating future research in animal 3D pose and shape estimation, and is publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Law enforcement regularly faces the challenge of ranking suspects from their facial images. Deep face models aid this process but frequently introduce biases that disproportionately affect certain demographic segments. While bias investigation is common in domains like job candidate ranking, the field of forensic face rankings remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel experimental framework, encompassing six state-of-the-art face encoders and two public data sets, designed to scrutinize the extent to which demographic groups suffer from biases in exposure in the context of forensic face rankings. Through comprehensive experiments that cover both re-identification and identification tasks, we show that exposure biases within this domain are far from being countered, demanding attention towards establishing ad-hoc policies and corrective measures.

<p>Abstract:<br>Hands are dexterous and highly versatile manipulators that are central to how humans interact with objects and their environment. Consequently, modeling realistic hand-object interactions, including the subtle motion of individual fingers, is critical for applications in computer graphics, computer vision, and mixed reality. Prior work on capturing and modeling humans interacting with objects in 3D focuses on the body and object motion, often ignoring hand pose. In contrast, we introduce GRIP, a learning-based method that takes, as input, the 3D motion of the body and the object, and synthesizes realistic motion for both hands before, during, and after object interaction. As a preliminary step before synthesizing the hand motion, we first use a network, ANet, to denoise the arm motion. Then, we leverage the spatio-temporal relationship between the body and the object to extract two types of novel temporal interaction cues, and use them in a two-stage inference pipeline to generate the hand motion. In the first stage, we introduce a new approach to enforce motion temporal consistency in the latent space (LTC), and generate consistent interaction motions. In the second stage, GRIP generates refined hand poses to avoid hand-object penetrations. Given sequences of noisy body and object motion, GRIP upgrades them to include hand-object interaction. Quantitative experiments and perceptual studies demonstrate that GRIP outperforms baseline methods and generalizes to unseen objects and motions from different motion-capture datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The increasing versatility of language models LMs has given rise to a new class of benchmarks that comprehensively assess a broad range of capabilities. Such benchmarks are associated with massive computational costs reaching thousands of GPU hours per model. However the efficiency aspect of these evaluation efforts had raised little discussion in the literature. In this work we present the problem of Efficient Benchmarking namely intelligently reducing the computation costs of LM evaluation without compromising reliability. Using the HELM benchmark as a test case we investigate how different benchmark design choices affect the computation-reliability tradeoff. We propose to evaluate the reliability of such decisions by using a new measure Decision Impact on Reliability DIoR for short. We find for example that the current leader on HELM may change by merely removing a low-ranked model from the benchmark and observe that a handful of examples suffice to obtain the correct benchmark ranking. Conversely a slightly different choice of HELM scenarios varies ranking widely. Based on our findings we outline a set of concrete recommendations for more efficient benchmark design and utilization practices leading to dramatic cost savings with minimal loss of benchmark reliability often reducing computation by x100 or more.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recent advances of monocular 3D object detection facilitate the 3D multi-object tracking task based on low-cost camera sensors. In this paper, we find that the motion cue of objects along different time frames is critical in 3D multi-object tracking, which is less explored in existing monocular-based approaches. In this paper, we propose a motion-aware framework for monocular 3D MOT. To this end, we propose MoMA-M3T, a framework that mainly consists of three motion-aware components. First, we represent the possible movement of an object related to all object tracklets in the feature space as its motion features. Then, we further model the historical object tracklet along the time frame in a spatial-temporal perspective via a motion transformer. Finally, we propose a motion-aware matching module to associate historical object tracklets and current observations as final tracking results. We conduct extensive experiments on the nuScenes and KITTI datasets to demonstrate that our MoMA-M3T achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the proposed tracker is flexible and can be easily plugged into existing image-based 3D object detectors without re-training.

<p>Abstract:<br>Generating video stories from text prompts is a complex task. In addition to having high visual quality, videos need to realistically adhere to a sequence of text prompts whilst being consistent throughout the frames. Creating a benchmark for video generation requires data annotated over time, which contrasts with the single caption used often in video datasets. To fill this gap, we collect comprehensive human annotations on three existing datasets, and introduce StoryBench: a new, challenging multi-task benchmark to reliably evaluate forthcoming text-to-video models. Our benchmark includes three video generation tasks of increasing difficulty: action execution, where the next action must be generated starting from a conditioning video; story continuation, where a sequence of actions must be executed starting from a conditioning video; and story generation, where a video must be generated from only text prompts. We evaluate small yet strong text-to-video baselines, and show the benefits of training on story-like data algorithmically generated from existing video captions. Finally, we establish guidelines for human evaluation of video stories, and reaffirm the need of better automatic metrics for video generation. StoryBench aims at encouraging future research efforts in this exciting new area.</p>

Self-supervised learning (SSL) has also shown promise in improving visual recognition by learning invariant features. However, the combination of CLIP with SSL is found to face challenges due to the multi-task framework that blends CLIP’s contrastive loss and SSL’s loss, including difficulties with loss weighting and inconsistency among different views of images in CLIP’s output space. To overcome these challenges, we propose a prompt learning-based model called GOPro, which is a unified framework that ensures similarity between various augmented views of input images in a shared image-text embedding space, using a pair of learnable image and text projectors atop CLIP, to promote invariance and generalizability. To automatically learn such prompts, we leverage the visual content and style primitives extracted from pre-trained CLIP and adapt them to the target task. In addition to CLIP’s cross-domain contrastive loss, we introduce a visual contrastive loss and a novel prompt consistency loss, considering the different views of the images. GOPro is trained end-to-end on all three loss objectives, combining the strengths of CLIP and SSL in a principled manner. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that GOPro outperforms the state-of-the-art prompting techniques on three challenging domain generalization tasks across multiple benchmarks by a significant margin.

<p>Abstract:<br>This study introduces a novel framework, G3Reg, for fast and robust global registration of LiDAR point clouds. In contrast to conventional complex keypoints and descriptors, we extract fundamental geometric primitives including planes, clusters, and lines (PCL) from the raw point cloud to obtain low-level semantic segments. Each segment is formulated as a unified Gaussian Ellipsoid Model (GEM) by employing a probability ellipsoid to ensure the ground truth centers are encompassed with a certain degree of probability. Utilizing these GEMs, we then present a distrust-and-verify scheme based on a Pyramid Compatibility Graph for Global Registration (PAGOR). Specifically, we establish an upper bound, which can be traversed based on the confidence level for compatibility testing to construct the pyramid graph. Gradually, we solve multiple maximum cliques (MAC) for each level of the graph, generating numerous transformation candidates. In the verification phase, we adopt a precise and efficient metric for point cloud alignment quality, founded on geometric primitives, to identify the optimal candidate. The performance of the algorithm is extensively validated on three publicly available datasets and a self-collected multi-session dataset, without changing any parameter settings in the experimental evaluation. The results exhibit superior robustness and real-time performance of the G3Reg framework compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential for integrating individual GEM and PAGOR components into other algorithmic frameworks to enhance their efficacy. To advance further research and promote community understanding, we have publicly shared the source code.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recent studies show that self-attentions behave like low-pass filters (as opposed to convolutions) and enhancing their high-pass filtering capability improves model performance. Contrary to this idea, we investigate existing convolution-based models with spectral analysis and observe that improving the low-pass filtering in convolution operations also leads to performance improvement. To account for this observation, we hypothesize that utilizing optimal token mixers that capture balanced representations of both high- and low-frequency components can enhance the performance of models. We verify this by decomposing visual features into the frequency domain and combining them in a balanced manner. To handle this, we replace the balancing problem with a mask filtering problem in the frequency domain. Then, we introduce a novel token-mixer named SPAM and leverage it to derive a MetaFormer model termed as SPANet. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides a way to achieve this balance, and the balanced representations of both high- and low-frequency components can improve the performance of models on multiple computer vision tasks.

<p>Abstract:<br>H-score is a semi-quantitative method used to assess the presence and distribution of proteins in tissue samples by combining the intensity of staining and percentage of stained nuclei. It is widely used but time-consuming and can be limited in accuracy and precision. Computer-aided methods may help overcome these limitations and improve the efficiency of pathologists’ workflows. In this work, we developed a model EndoNet for automatic calculation of H-score on histological slides. Our proposed method uses neural networks and consists of two main parts. The first is a detection model which predicts keypoints of centers of nuclei. The second is a H-score module which calculates the value of the H-score using mean pixel values of predicted keypoints. Our model was trained and validated on 1780 annotated tiles with a shape of 100x100 $\mu m$ and performed 0.77 mAP on a test dataset. Moreover, the model can be adjusted to a specific specialist or whole laboratory to reproduce the manner of calculating the H-score. Thus, EndoNet is effective and robust in the analysis of histology slides, which can improve and significantly accelerate the work of pathologists.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This report details the method of the winning entry of the AVDN Challenge in ICCV 2023. The competition addresses the Aerial Navigation from Dialog History (ANDH) task, which requires a drone agent to associate dialog history with aerial observations to reach the destination. For better cross-modal grounding abilities of the drone agent, we propose a Target-Grounded Graph-Aware Transformer (TG-GAT) framework. Concretely, TG-GAT first leverages a graph-aware transformer to capture spatiotemporal dependency, which benefits navigation state tracking and robust action planning. In addition, an auxiliary visual grounding task is devised to boost the agent’s awareness of referred landmarks. Moreover, a hybrid augmentation strategy based on large language models is utilized to mitigate data scarcity limitations. Our TG-GAT framework won the AVDN Challenge 2023, with 2.2% and 3.0% absolute improvements over the baseline on SPL and SR metrics, respectively.

<p>Abstract:<br>AI-generated images have become increasingly realistic and have garnered significant public attention. While synthetic images are intriguing due to their realism, they also pose an important misinformation threat. To address this new threat, researchers have developed multiple algorithms to detect synthetic images and identify their source generators. However, most existing source attribution techniques are designed to operate in a closed-set scenario, i.e. they can only be used to discriminate between known image generators. By contrast, new image-generation techniques are rapidly emerging. To contend with this, there is a great need for open-set source attribution techniques that can identify when synthetic images have originated from new, unseen generators. To address this problem, we propose a new metric learning-based approach. Our technique works by learning transferrable embeddings capable of discriminating between generators, even when they are not seen during training. An image is first assigned to a candidate generator, then is accepted or rejected based on its distance in the embedding space from known generators’ learned reference points. Importantly, we identify that initializing our source attribution embedding network by pretraining it on image camera identification can improve our embeddings’ transferability. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate our approach’s ability to attribute the source of synthetic images in open-set scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Video-Text Retrieval (VTR) is a crucial multi-modal task in an era of massive video-text data on the Internet. A plethora of work characterized by using a two-stream Vision-Language model architecture that learns a joint representation of video-text pairs has become a prominent approach for the VTR task. However, these models operate under the assumption of bijective video-text correspondences and neglect a more practical scenario where video content usually encompasses multiple events, while texts like user queries or webpage metadata tend to be specific and correspond to single events. This establishes a gap between the previous training objective and real-world applications, leading to the potential performance degradation of earlier models during inference. In this study, we introduce the Multi-event Video-Text Retrieval (MeVTR) task, addressing scenarios in which each video contains multiple different events, as a niche scenario of the conventional Video-Text Retrieval Task. We present a simple model, Me-Retriever, which incorporates key event video representation and a new MeVTR loss for the MeVTR task. Comprehensive experiments show that this straightforward framework outperforms other models in the Video-to-Text and Text-to-Video tasks, effectively establishing a robust baseline for the MeVTR task. We believe this work serves as a strong foundation for future studies.
