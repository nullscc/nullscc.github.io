<p>Abstract:<br>We examine the disconnect between scholarship and practice in applying machine learning to trust and safety problems, using misinformation detection as a case study. We systematize literature on automated detection of misinformation across a corpus of 270 well-cited papers in the field. We then examine subsets of papers for data and code availability, design missteps, reproducibility, and generalizability. We find significant shortcomings in the literature that call into question claimed performance and practicality. Detection tasks are often meaningfully distinct from the challenges that online services actually face. Datasets and model evaluation are often non-representative of real-world contexts, and evaluation frequently is not independent of model training. Data and code availability is poor. Models do not generalize well to out-of-domain data. Based on these results, we offer recommendations for evaluating machine learning applications to trust and safety problems. Our aim is for future work to avoid the pitfalls that we identify.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Network momentum provides a novel type of risk premium, which exploits the interconnections among assets in a financial network to predict future returns. However, the current process of constructing financial networks relies heavily on expensive databases and financial expertise, limiting accessibility for small-sized and academic institutions. Furthermore, the traditional approach treats network construction and portfolio optimisation as separate tasks, potentially hindering optimal portfolio performance. To address these challenges, we propose L2GMOM, an end-to-end machine learning framework that simultaneously learns financial networks and optimises trading signals for network momentum strategies. The model of L2GMOM is a neural network with a highly interpretable forward propagation architecture, which is derived from algorithm unrolling. The L2GMOM is flexible and can be trained with diverse loss functions for portfolio performance, e.g. the negative Sharpe ratio. Backtesting on 64 continuous future contracts demonstrates a significant improvement in portfolio profitability and risk control, with a Sharpe ratio of 1.74 across a 20-year period.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Differentially Private Federated Learning (DP-FL) has garnered attention as a collaborative machine learning approach that ensures formal privacy. Most DP-FL approaches ensure DP at the record-level within each silo for cross-silo FL. However, a single user’s data may extend across multiple silos, and the desired user-level DP guarantee for such a setting remains unknown. In this study, we present ULDP-FL, a novel FL framework designed to guarantee user-level DP in cross-silo FL where a single user’s data may belong to multiple silos. Our proposed algorithm directly ensures user-level DP through per-user weighted clipping, departing from group-privacy approaches. We provide a theoretical analysis of the algorithm’s privacy and utility. Additionally, we enhance the algorithm’s utility and showcase its private implementation using cryptographic building blocks. Empirical experiments on real-world datasets show substantial improvements in our methods in privacy-utility trade-offs under user-level DP compared to baseline methods. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first FL framework that effectively provides user-level DP in the general cross-silo FL setting.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Curriculum learning (CL) posits that machine learning models – similar to humans – may learn more efficiently from data that match their current learning progress. However, CL methods are still poorly understood and, in particular for natural language processing (NLP), have achieved only limited success. In this paper, we explore why. Starting from an attempt to replicate and extend a number of recent curriculum methods, we find that their results are surprisingly brittle when applied to NLP. A deep dive into the (in)effectiveness of the curricula in some scenarios shows us why: when curricula are employed in combination with the popular Adam optimisation algorithm, they oftentimes learn to adapt to suboptimally chosen optimisation parameters for this algorithm. We present a number of different case studies with different common hand-crafted and automated CL approaches to illustrate this phenomenon, and we find that none of them outperforms optimisation with only Adam with well-chosen hyperparameters. As such, our results contribute to understanding why CL methods work, but at the same time urge caution when claiming positive results.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Predicting the solubility of given molecules is an important task in the pharmaceutical industry, and consequently this is a well-studied topic. In this research, we revisited this problem with the advantage of modern computing resources. We applied two machine learning models, a linear regression model and a graph convolutional neural network model, on multiple experimental datasets. Both methods can make reasonable predictions while the GCNN model had the best performance. However, the current GCNN model is a black box, while feature importance analysis from the linear regression model offers more insights into the underlying chemical influences. Using the linear regression model, we show how each functional group affects the overall solubility. Ultimately, knowing how chemical structure influences chemical properties is crucial when designing new drugs. Future work should aim to combine the high performance of GCNNs with the interpretability of linear regression, unlocking new advances in next generation high throughput screening.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The magnetic inversion method is one of the non-destructive geophysical methods, which aims to estimate the subsurface susceptibility distribution from surface magnetic anomaly data. Recently, supervised deep learning methods have been widely utilized in lots of geophysical fields including magnetic inversion. However, these methods rely heavily on synthetic training data, whose performance is limited since the synthetic data is not independently and identically distributed with the field data. Thus, we proposed to realize magnetic inversion by self-supervised deep learning. The proposed self-supervised knowledge-driven 3D magnetic inversion method (SSKMI) learns on the target field data by a closed loop of the inversion and forward models. Given that the parameters of the forward model are preset, SSKMI can optimize the inversion model by minimizing the mean absolute error between observed and re-estimated surface magnetic anomalies. Besides, there is a knowledge-driven module in the proposed inversion model, which makes the deep learning method more explicable. Meanwhile, comparative experiments demonstrate that the knowledge-driven module can accelerate the training of the proposed method and achieve better results. Since magnetic inversion is an ill-pose task, SSKMI proposed to constrain the inversion model by a guideline in the auxiliary loop. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is a reliable magnetic inversion method with outstanding performance.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper presents, in a unified fashion, deterministic as well as statistical Lagrangian-verification techniques. They formally quantify the behavioral robustness of any time-continuous process, formulated as a continuous-depth model. To this end, we review LRT-NG, SLR, and GoTube, algorithms for constructing a tight reachtube, that is, an over-approximation of the set of states reachable within a given time-horizon, and provide guarantees for the reachtube bounds. We compare the usage of the variational equations, associated to the system equations, the mean value theorem, and the Lipschitz constants, in achieving deterministic and statistical guarantees. In LRT-NG, the Lipschitz constant is used as a bloating factor of the initial perturbation, to compute the radius of an ellipsoid in an optimal metric, which over-approximates the set of reachable states. In SLR and GoTube, we get statistical guarantees, by using the Lipschitz constants to compute local balls around samples. These are needed to calculate the probability of having found an upper bound, of the true maximum perturbation at every timestep. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Lagrangian techniques, when compared to LRT, Flow*, and CAPD, and illustrate their use in the robustness analysis of various continuous-depth models.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Lung cancer is a significant cause of mortality worldwide, emphasizing the importance of early detection for improved survival rates. In this study, we propose a machine learning (ML) tool trained on data from the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial and validated on the NLST to estimate the likelihood of lung cancer occurrence within five years. The study utilized two datasets, the PLCO (n&#x3D;55,161) and NLST (n&#x3D;48,595), consisting of comprehensive information on risk factors, clinical measurements, and outcomes related to lung cancer. Data preprocessing involved removing patients who were not current or former smokers and those who had died of causes unrelated to lung cancer. Additionally, a focus was placed on mitigating bias caused by censored data. Feature selection, hyper-parameter optimization, and model calibration were performed using XGBoost, an ensemble learning algorithm that combines gradient boosting and decision trees. The ML model was trained on the pre-processed PLCO dataset and tested on the NLST dataset. The model incorporated features such as age, gender, smoking history, medical diagnoses, and family history of lung cancer. The model was well-calibrated (Brier score&#x3D;0.044). ROC-AUC was 82% on the PLCO dataset and 70% on the NLST dataset. PR-AUC was 29% and 11% respectively. When compared to the USPSTF guidelines for lung cancer screening, our model provided the same recall with a precision of 13.1% vs. 9.3% on the PLCO dataset and 3.2% vs. 3.1% on the NLST dataset. The developed ML tool provides a freely available web application for estimating the likelihood of developing lung cancer within five years. By utilizing risk factors and clinical data, individuals can assess their risk and make informed decisions regarding lung cancer screening. This research contributes to the efforts in early detection and prevention strategies, aiming to reduce lung cancer-related mortality rates.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In a connection of many IoT devices that each collect data, normally training a machine learning model would involve transmitting the data to a central server which requires strict privacy rules. However, some owners are reluctant of availing their data out of the company due to data security concerns. Federated learning(FL) as a distributed machine learning approach performs training of a machine learning model on the device that gathered the data itself. In this scenario, data is not share over the network for training purpose. Fedavg as one of FL algorithms permits a model to be copied to participating devices during a training session. The devices could be chosen at random, and a device can be aborted. The resulting models are sent to the coordinating server and then average models from the devices that finished training. The process is repeated until a desired model accuracy is achieved. By doing this, FL approach solves the privacy problem for IoT&#x2F; IIoT devices that held sensitive data for the owners. In this paper, we leverage the benefits of FL and implemented Fedavg algorithm on a recent dataset that represent the modern IoT&#x2F; IIoT device networks. The results were almost the same as the centralized machine learning approach. We also evaluated some shortcomings of Fedavg such as unfairness that happens during the training when struggling devices do not participate for every stage of training. This inefficient training of local or global model could lead in a high number of false alarms in intrusion detection systems for IoT&#x2F;IIoT gadgets developed using Fedavg. Hence, after evaluating the FedAv deep auto encoder with centralized deep auto encoder ML, we further proposed and designed a Fair Fedavg algorithm that will be evaluated in the future work.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We introduce the concept of decision-focused surrogate modeling for solving computationally challenging nonlinear optimization problems in real-time settings. The proposed data-driven framework seeks to learn a simpler, e.g. convex, surrogate optimization model that is trained to minimize the decision prediction error, which is defined as the difference between the optimal solutions of the original and the surrogate optimization models. The learning problem, formulated as a bilevel program, can be viewed as a data-driven inverse optimization problem to which we apply a decomposition-based solution algorithm from previous work. We validate our framework through numerical experiments involving the optimization of common nonlinear chemical processes such as chemical reactors, heat exchanger networks, and material blending systems. We also present a detailed comparison of decision-focused surrogate modeling with standard data-driven surrogate modeling methods and demonstrate that our approach is significantly more data-efficient while producing simple surrogate models with high decision prediction accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Membership Inference Attack (MIA) identifies whether a record exists in a machine learning model’s training set by querying the model. MIAs on the classic classification models have been well-studied, and recent works have started to explore how to transplant MIA onto generative models. Our investigation indicates that existing MIAs designed for generative models mainly depend on the overfitting in target models. However, overfitting can be avoided by employing various regularization techniques, whereas existing MIAs demonstrate poor performance in practice. Unlike overfitting, memorization is essential for deep learning models to attain optimal performance, making it a more prevalent phenomenon. Memorization in generative models leads to an increasing trend in the probability distribution of generating records around the member record. Therefore, we propose a Probabilistic Fluctuation Assessing Membership Inference Attack (PFAMI), a black-box MIA that infers memberships by detecting these trends via analyzing the overall probabilistic fluctuations around given records. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple generative models and datasets, which demonstrate PFAMI can improve the attack success rate (ASR) by about 27.9% when compared with the best baseline.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Models for fine-grained image classification tasks, where the difference between some classes can be extremely subtle and the number of samples per class tends to be low, are particularly prone to picking up background-related biases and demand robust methods to handle potential examples with out-of-distribution (OOD) backgrounds. To gain deeper insights into this critical problem, our research investigates the impact of background-induced bias on fine-grained image classification, evaluating standard backbone models such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT). We explore two masking strategies to mitigate background-induced bias: Early masking, which removes background information at the (input) image level, and late masking, which selectively masks high-level spatial features corresponding to the background. Extensive experiments assess the behavior of CNN and ViT models under different masking strategies, with a focus on their generalization to OOD backgrounds. The obtained findings demonstrate that both proposed strategies enhance OOD performance compared to the baseline models, with early masking consistently exhibiting the best OOD performance. Notably, a ViT variant employing GAP-Pooled Patch token-based classification combined with early masking achieves the highest OOD robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We propose an accelerated block proximal linear framework with adaptive momentum (ABPL$^+$) for nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization. We analyze the potential causes of the extrapolation step failing in some algorithms, and resolve this issue by enhancing the comparison process that evaluates the trade-off between the proximal gradient step and the linear extrapolation step in our algorithm. Furthermore, we extends our algorithm to any scenario involving updating block variables with positive integers, allowing each cycle to randomly shuffle the update order of the variable blocks. Additionally, under mild assumptions, we prove that ABPL$^+$ can monotonically decrease the function value without strictly restricting the extrapolation parameters and step size, demonstrates the viability and effectiveness of updating these blocks in a random order, and we also more obviously and intuitively demonstrate that the derivative set of the sequence generated by our algorithm is a critical point set. Moreover, we demonstrate the global convergence as well as the linear and sublinear convergence rates of our algorithm by utilizing the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (K{\L}) condition. To enhance the effectiveness and flexibility of our algorithm, we also expand the study to the imprecise version of our algorithm and construct an adaptive extrapolation parameter strategy, which improving its overall performance. We apply our algorithm to multiple non-negative matrix factorization with the $\ell_0$ norm, nonnegative tensor decomposition with the $\ell_0$ norm, and perform extensive numerical experiments to validate its effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Parameterizable machine learning (ML) accelerators are the product of recent breakthroughs in ML. To fully enable their design space exploration (DSE), we propose a physical-design-driven, learning-based prediction framework for hardware-accelerated deep neural network (DNN) and non-DNN ML algorithms. It adopts a unified approach that combines backend power, performance, and area (PPA) analysis with frontend performance simulation, thereby achieving a realistic estimation of both backend PPA and system metrics such as runtime and energy. In addition, our framework includes a fully automated DSE technique, which optimizes backend and system metrics through an automated search of architectural and backend parameters. Experimental studies show that our approach consistently predicts backend PPA and system metrics with an average 7% or less prediction error for the ASIC implementation of two deep learning accelerator platforms, VTA and VeriGOOD-ML, in both a commercial 12 nm process and a research-oriented 45 nm process.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Group sparsity in Machine Learning (ML) encourages simpler, more interpretable models with fewer active parameter groups. This work aims to incorporate structured group sparsity into the shared parameters of a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework, to develop parsimonious models that can effectively address multiple tasks with fewer parameters while maintaining comparable or superior performance to a dense model. Sparsifying the model during training helps decrease the model’s memory footprint, computation requirements, and prediction time during inference. We use channel-wise l1&#x2F;l2 group sparsity in the shared layers of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This approach not only facilitates the elimination of extraneous groups (channels) but also imposes a penalty on the weights, thereby enhancing the learning of all tasks. We compare the outcomes of single-task and multi-task experiments under group sparsity on two publicly available MTL datasets, NYU-v2 and CelebAMask-HQ. We also investigate how changing the sparsification degree impacts both the performance of the model and the sparsity of groups.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Most of Continual Learning (CL) methods push the limit of supervised learning settings, where an agent is expected to learn new labeled tasks and not forget previous knowledge. However, these settings are not well aligned with real-life scenarios, where a learning agent has access to a vast amount of unlabeled data encompassing both novel (entirely unlabeled) classes and examples from known classes. Drawing inspiration from Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), we introduce a novel framework that relaxes this assumption. Precisely, in any task, we allow for the existence of novel and known classes, and one must use continual version of unsupervised learning methods to discover them. We call this setting Generalized Continual Category Discovery (GCCD). It unifies CL and GCD, bridging the gap between synthetic benchmarks and real-life scenarios. With a series of experiments, we present that existing methods fail to accumulate knowledge from subsequent tasks in which unlabeled samples of novel classes are present. In light of these limitations, we propose a method that incorporates both supervised and unsupervised signals and mitigates the forgetting through the use of centroid adaptation. Our method surpasses strong CL methods adopted for GCD techniques and presents a superior representation learning performance.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We present Constrained Stein Variational Trajectory Optimization (CSVTO), an algorithm for performing trajectory optimization with constraints on a set of trajectories in parallel. We frame constrained trajectory optimization as a novel form of constrained functional minimization over trajectory distributions, which avoids treating the constraints as a penalty in the objective and allows us to generate diverse sets of constraint-satisfying trajectories. Our method uses Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) to find a set of particles that approximates a distribution over low-cost trajectories while obeying constraints. CSVTO is applicable to problems with arbitrary equality and inequality constraints and includes a novel particle resampling step to escape local minima. By explicitly generating diverse sets of trajectories, CSVTO is better able to avoid poor local minima and is more robust to initialization. We demonstrate that CSVTO outperforms baselines in challenging highly-constrained tasks, such as a 7DoF wrench manipulation task, where CSVTO succeeds in 20&#x2F;20 trials vs 13&#x2F;20 for the closest baseline. Our results demonstrate that generating diverse constraint-satisfying trajectories improves robustness to disturbances and initialization over baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Deep neural networks (DNN) are singular statistical models which exhibit complex degeneracies. In this work, we illustrate how a quantity known as the \emph{learning coefficient} introduced in singular learning theory quantifies precisely the degree of degeneracy in deep neural networks. Importantly, we will demonstrate that degeneracy in DNN cannot be accounted for by simply counting the number of “flat” directions. We propose a computationally scalable approximation of a localized version of the learning coefficient using stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics. To validate our approach, we demonstrate its accuracy in low-dimensional models with known theoretical values. Importantly, the local learning coefficient can correctly recover the ordering of degeneracy between various parameter regions of interest. An experiment on MNIST shows the local learning coefficient can reveal the inductive bias of stochastic opitmizers for more or less degenerate critical points.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a powerful tool for handling structured graph data and addressing tasks such as node classification, graph classification, and clustering. However, the sparse nature of GNN computation poses new challenges for performance optimization compared to traditional deep neural networks. We address these challenges by providing a unified view of GNN computation, I&#x2F;O, and memory. By analyzing the computational graphs of the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Graph Attention (GAT) layers – two widely used GNN layers – we propose alternative computation strategies. We present adaptive operator reordering with caching, which achieves a speedup of up to 2.43x for GCN compared to the current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, an exploration of different caching schemes for GAT yields a speedup of up to 1.94x. The proposed optimizations save memory, are easily implemented across various hardware platforms, and have the potential to alleviate performance bottlenecks in training large-scale GNN models.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Numerous theories of learning suggest to prevent the gradient variance from exponential growth with depth or time, to stabilize and improve training. Typically, these analyses are conducted on feed-forward fully-connected neural networks or single-layer recurrent neural networks, given their mathematical tractability. In contrast, this study demonstrates that pre-training the network to local stability can be effective whenever the architectures are too complex for an analytical initialization. Furthermore, we extend known stability theories to encompass a broader family of deep recurrent networks, requiring minimal assumptions on data and parameter distribution, a theory that we refer to as the Local Stability Condition (LSC). Our investigation reveals that the classical Glorot, He, and Orthogonal initialization schemes satisfy the LSC when applied to feed-forward fully-connected neural networks. However, analysing deep recurrent networks, we identify a new additive source of exponential explosion that emerges from counting gradient paths in a rectangular grid in depth and time. We propose a new approach to mitigate this issue, that consists on giving a weight of a half to the time and depth contributions to the gradient, instead of the classical weight of one. Our empirical results confirm that pre-training both feed-forward and recurrent networks to fulfill the LSC often results in improved final performance across models. This study contributes to the field by providing a means to stabilize networks of any complexity. Our approach can be implemented as an additional step before pre-training on large augmented datasets, and as an alternative to finding stable initializations analytically.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The driving style of an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) refers to how it behaves and interacts with other AVs. In a multi-vehicle autonomous driving system, an AV capable of identifying the driving styles of its nearby AVs can reliably evaluate the risk of collisions and make more reasonable driving decisions. However, there has not been a consistent definition of driving styles for an AV in the literature, although it is considered that the driving style is encoded in the AV’s trajectories and can be identified using Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning (ME-IRL) methods as a cost function. Nevertheless, an important indicator of the driving style, i.e., how an AV reacts to its nearby AVs, is not fully incorporated in the feature design of previous ME-IRL methods. In this paper, we describe the driving style as a cost function of a series of weighted features. We design additional novel features to capture the AV’s reaction-aware characteristics. Then, we identify the driving styles from the demonstration trajectories generated by the Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) using a modified ME-IRL method with our newly proposed features. The proposed method is validated using MATLAB simulation and an off-the-shelf experiment.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Multimodal large language models acquire their instruction-following capabilities through a two-stage training process: pre-training on image-text pairs and fine-tuning on supervised vision-language instruction data. Recent studies have shown that large language models can achieve satisfactory results even with a limited amount of high-quality instruction-following data. In this paper, we introduce InstructionGPT-4, which is fine-tuned on a small dataset comprising only 200 examples, amounting to approximately 6% of the instruction-following data used in the alignment dataset for MiniGPT-4. We first propose several metrics to access the quality of multimodal instruction data. Based on these metrics, we present a simple and effective data selector to automatically identify and filter low-quality vision-language data. By employing this method, InstructionGPT-4 outperforms the original MiniGPT-4 on various evaluations (e.g., visual question answering, GPT-4 preference). Overall, our findings demonstrate that less but high-quality instruction tuning data is efficient to enable multimodal large language models to generate better output.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Large language models (LLMs) based on transformers have made significant strides in recent years, the success of which is driven by scaling up their model size. Despite their high algorithmic performance, the computational and memory requirements of LLMs present unprecedented challenges. To tackle the high compute requirements of LLMs, the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture was introduced which is able to scale its model size without proportionally scaling up its computational requirements. Unfortunately, MoE’s high memory demands and dynamic activation of sparse experts restrict its applicability to real-world problems. Previous solutions that offload MoE’s memory-hungry expert parameters to CPU memory fall short because the latency to migrate activated experts from CPU to GPU incurs high performance overhead. Our proposed Pre-gated MoE system effectively tackles the compute and memory challenges of conventional MoE architectures using our algorithm-system co-design. Pre-gated MoE employs our novel pre-gating function which alleviates the dynamic nature of sparse expert activation, allowing our proposed system to address the large memory footprint of MoEs while also achieving high performance. We demonstrate that Pre-gated MoE is able to improve performance, reduce GPU memory consumption, while also maintaining the same level of model quality. These features allow our Pre-gated MoE system to cost-effectively deploy large-scale LLMs using just a single GPU with high performance.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Machine Learning (ML) algorithms that perform classification may predict the wrong class, experiencing misclassifications. It is well-known that misclassifications may have cascading effects on the encompassing system, possibly resulting in critical failures. This paper proposes SPROUT, a Safety wraPper thROugh ensembles of UncertainTy measures, which suspects misclassifications by computing uncertainty measures on the inputs and outputs of a black-box classifier. If a misclassification is detected, SPROUT blocks the propagation of the output of the classifier to the encompassing system. The resulting impact on safety is that SPROUT transforms erratic outputs (misclassifications) into data omission failures, which can be easily managed at the system level. SPROUT has a broad range of applications as it fits binary and multi-class classification, comprising image and tabular datasets. We experimentally show that SPROUT always identifies a huge fraction of the misclassifications of supervised classifiers, and it is able to detect all misclassifications in specific cases. SPROUT implementation contains pre-trained wrappers, it is publicly available and ready to be deployed with minimal effort.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Small farms contribute to a large share of the productive land in developing countries. In regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, where 80% of farms are small (under 2 ha in size), the task of mapping smallholder cropland is an important part of tracking sustainability measures such as crop productivity. However, the visually diverse and nuanced appearance of small farms has limited the effectiveness of traditional approaches to cropland mapping. Here we introduce a new approach based on the detection of harvest piles characteristic of many smallholder systems throughout the world. We present HarvestNet, a dataset for mapping the presence of farms in the Ethiopian regions of Tigray and Amhara during 2020-2023, collected using expert knowledge and satellite images, totaling 7k hand-labeled images and 2k ground collected labels. We also benchmark a set of baselines including SOTA models in remote sensing with our best models having around 80% classification performance on hand labelled data and 90%, 98% accuracy on ground truth data for Tigray, Amhara respectively. We also perform a visual comparison with a widely used pre-existing coverage map and show that our model detects an extra 56,621 hectares of cropland in Tigray. We conclude that remote sensing of harvest piles can contribute to more timely and accurate cropland assessments in food insecure region.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Generative text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion allow users to generate images based on a textual description, the prompt. Changing the prompt is still the primary means for the user to change a generated image as desired. However, changing the image by reformulating the prompt remains a difficult process of trial and error, which has led to the emergence of prompt engineering as a new field of research. We propose and analyze methods to change the embedding of a prompt directly instead of the prompt text. It allows for more fine-grained and targeted control that takes into account user intentions. Our approach treats the generative text-to-image model as a continuous function and passes gradients between the image space and the prompt embedding space. By addressing different user interaction problems, we can apply this idea in three scenarios: (1) Optimization of a metric defined in image space that could measure, for example, image style. (2) Assistance of users in creative tasks by enabling them to navigate the image space along a selection of directions of “near” prompt embeddings. (3) Changing the embedding of the prompt to include information that the user has seen in a particular seed but finds difficult to describe in the prompt. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the described methods.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>It is becoming increasingly important to understand the vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial attacks. One of the fundamental problems in adversarial machine learning is to quantify how much training data is needed in the presence of evasion attacks, where data is corrupted at test time. In this thesis, we work with the exact-in-the-ball notion of robustness and study the feasibility of adversarially robust learning from the perspective of learning theory, considering sample complexity.   We first explore the setting where the learner has access to random examples only, and show that distributional assumptions are essential. We then focus on learning problems with distributions on the input data that satisfy a Lipschitz condition and show that robustly learning monotone conjunctions has sample complexity at least exponential in the adversary’s budget (the maximum number of bits it can perturb on each input). However, if the adversary is restricted to perturbing $O(\log n)$ bits, then one can robustly learn conjunctions and decision lists w.r.t. log-Lipschitz distributions.   We then study learning models where the learner is given more power. We first consider local membership queries, where the learner can query the label of points near the training sample. We show that, under the uniform distribution, the exponential dependence on the adversary’s budget to robustly learn conjunctions remains inevitable. We then introduce a local equivalence query oracle, which returns whether the hypothesis and target concept agree in a given region around a point in the training sample, and a counterexample if it exists. We show that if the query radius is equal to the adversary’s budget, we can develop robust empirical risk minimization algorithms in the distribution-free setting. We give general query complexity upper and lower bounds, as well as for concrete concept classes.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In this paper, we present Layer-wise Feedback Propagation (LFP), a novel training approach for neural-network-like predictors that utilizes explainability, specifically Layer-wise Relevance Propagation(LRP), to assign rewards to individual connections based on their respective contributions to solving a given task. This differs from traditional gradient descent, which updates parameters towards anestimated loss minimum. LFP distributes a reward signal throughout the model without the need for gradient computations. It then strengthens structures that receive positive feedback while reducingthe influence of structures that receive negative feedback. We establish the convergence of LFP theoretically and empirically, and demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving comparable performance to gradient descent on various models and datasets. Notably, LFP overcomes certain limitations associated with gradient-based methods, such as reliance on meaningful derivatives. We further investigate how the different LRP-rules can be extended to LFP, what their effects are on training, as well as potential applications, such as training models with no meaningful derivatives, e.g., step-function activated Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), or for transfer learning, to efficiently utilize existing knowledge.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Sparsity is a highly desired feature in deep neural networks (DNNs) since it ensures numerical efficiency, improves the interpretability of models (due to the smaller number of relevant features), and robustness. In machine learning approaches based on linear models, it is well known that there exists a connecting path between the sparsest solution in terms of the $\ell^1$ norm (i.e., zero weights) and the non-regularized solution, which is called the regularization path. Very recently, there was a first attempt to extend the concept of regularization paths to DNNs by means of treating the empirical loss and sparsity ($\ell^1$ norm) as two conflicting criteria and solving the resulting multiobjective optimization problem. However, due to the non-smoothness of the $\ell^1$ norm and the high number of parameters, this approach is not very efficient from a computational perspective. To overcome this limitation, we present an algorithm that allows for the approximation of the entire Pareto front for the above-mentioned objectives in a very efficient manner. We present numerical examples using both deterministic and stochastic gradients. We furthermore demonstrate that knowledge of the regularization path allows for a well-generalizing network parametrization.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>With the increasing size of pre-trained language models (PLMs), fine-tuning all the parameters in the model is not efficient, especially when there are a large number of downstream tasks, which incur significant training and storage costs. Many parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches have been proposed, among which, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a representative approach that injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into every target module. Yet LoRA ignores the importance of parameters in different modules. To address this problem, many works have been proposed to prune the parameters of LoRA. However, under limited training conditions, the upper bound of the rank of the pruned parameter matrix is still affected by the preset values. We, therefore, propose IncreLoRA, an incremental parameter allocation method that adaptively adds trainable parameters during training based on the importance scores of each module. This approach is different from the pruning method as it is not limited by the initial number of training parameters, and each parameter matrix has a higher rank upper bound for the same training overhead. We conduct extensive experiments on GLUE to demonstrate the effectiveness of IncreLoRA. The results show that our method owns higher parameter efficiency, especially when under the low-resource settings where our method significantly outperforms the baselines. Our code is publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The availability of large data sets is providing an impetus for driving current artificial intelligent developments. There are, however, challenges for developing solutions with small data sets due to practical and cost-effective deployment and the opacity of deep learning models. The Comprehensive Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures called CACTUS is presented for improved secure analytics by effectively employing explainable artificial intelligence. It provides additional support for categorical attributes, preserving their original meaning, optimising memory usage, and speeding up the computation through parallelisation. It shows to the user the frequency of the attributes in each class and ranks them by their discriminative power. Its performance is assessed by application to the Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer and Thyroid0387 data sets.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recently, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 have attracted great attention given their surprising improvement and performance. Length controlled generation of LLMs emerges as an important topic, which also enables users to fully leverage the capability of LLMs in more real-world scenarios like generating a proper answer or essay of a desired length. In addition, the autoregressive generation in LLMs is extremely time-consuming, while the ability of controlling this generated length can arbitrarily reduce the inference cost by limiting the length, and thus satisfy different needs. Therefore, we aim to propose a prompt-based length control method to achieve this length controlled generation, which can also be widely applied in GPT-style LLMs. In particular, we adopt reinforcement learning with the reward signal given by either trainable or rule-based reward model, which further affects the generation of LLMs via rewarding a pre-defined target length. Experiments show that our method significantly improves the accuracy of prompt-based length control for summarization task on popular datasets like CNNDM and NYT. We believe this length-controllable ability can provide more potentials towards the era of LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Multi-task learning (MTL), a learning paradigm to learn multiple related tasks simultaneously, has achieved great success in various fields. However, task-balancing remains a significant challenge in MTL, with the disparity in loss&#x2F;gradient scales often leading to performance compromises. In this paper, we propose a Scale-Invariant Multi-Task Learning (SI-MTL) method to alleviate the task-balancing problem from both loss and gradient perspectives. Specifically, SI-MTL contains a logarithm transformation which is performed on all task losses to ensure scale-invariant at the loss level, and a gradient balancing method, SI-G, which normalizes all task gradients to the same magnitude as the maximum gradient norm. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of SI-G and the state-of-the-art performance of SI-MTL.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Differentially private SGD (DP-SGD) holds the promise of enabling the safe and responsible application of machine learning to sensitive datasets. However, DP-SGD only provides a biased, noisy estimate of a mini-batch gradient. This renders optimisation steps less effective and limits model utility as a result. With this work, we show a connection between per-sample gradient norms and the estimation bias of the private gradient oracle used in DP-SGD. Here, we propose Bias-Aware Minimisation (BAM) that allows for the provable reduction of private gradient estimator bias. We show how to efficiently compute quantities needed for BAM to scale to large neural networks and highlight similarities to closely related methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimisation. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that BAM not only reduces bias but also substantially improves privacy-utility trade-offs on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-32 datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We present a novel model Graph Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Graph Neural SDEs). This technique enhances the Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Graph Neural ODEs) by embedding randomness into data representation using Brownian motion. This inclusion allows for the assessment of prediction uncertainty, a crucial aspect frequently missed in current models. In our framework, we spotlight the \textit{Latent Graph Neural SDE} variant, demonstrating its effectiveness. Through empirical studies, we find that Latent Graph Neural SDEs surpass conventional models like Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Neural ODEs, especially in confidence prediction, making them superior in handling out-of-distribution detection across both static and spatio-temporal contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Generative models realized with machine learning techniques are powerful tools to infer complex and unknown data distributions from a finite number of training samples in order to produce new synthetic data. Diffusion models are an emerging framework that have recently overcome the performance of the generative adversarial networks in creating synthetic text and high-quality images. Here, we propose and discuss the quantum generalization of diffusion models, i.e., three quantum-noise-driven generative diffusion models that could be experimentally tested on real quantum systems. The idea is to harness unique quantum features, in particular the non-trivial interplay among coherence, entanglement and noise that the currently available noisy quantum processors do unavoidably suffer from, in order to overcome the main computational burdens of classical diffusion models during inference. Hence, we suggest to exploit quantum noise not as an issue to be detected and solved but instead as a very remarkably beneficial key ingredient to generate much more complex probability distributions that would be difficult or even impossible to express classically, and from which a quantum processor might sample more efficiently than a classical one. Therefore, our results are expected to pave the way for new quantum-inspired or quantum-based generative diffusion algorithms addressing more powerfully classical tasks as data generation&#x2F;prediction with widespread real-world applications ranging from climate forecasting to neuroscience, from traffic flow analysis to financial forecasting.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Hysteresis is a ubiquitous phenomenon in science and engineering; its modeling and identification are crucial for understanding and optimizing the behavior of various systems. We develop an ordinary differential equation-based recurrent neural network (RNN) approach to model and quantify the hysteresis, which manifests itself in sequentiality and history-dependence. Our neural oscillator, HystRNN, draws inspiration from coupled-oscillatory RNN and phenomenological hysteresis models to update the hidden states. The performance of HystRNN is evaluated to predict generalized scenarios, involving first-order reversal curves and minor loops. The findings show the ability of HystRNN to generalize its behavior to previously untrained regions, an essential feature that hysteresis models must have. This research highlights the advantage of neural oscillators over the traditional RNN-based methods in capturing complex hysteresis patterns in magnetic materials, where traditional rate-dependent methods are inadequate to capture intrinsic nonlinearity.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>As AI systems have obtained significant performance to be deployed widely in our daily live and human society, people both enjoy the benefits brought by these technologies and suffer many social issues induced by these systems. To make AI systems good enough and trustworthy, plenty of researches have been done to build guidelines for trustworthy AI systems. Machine learning is one of the most important parts for AI systems and representation learning is the fundamental technology in machine learning. How to make the representation learning trustworthy in real-world application, e.g., cross domain scenarios, is very valuable and necessary for both machine learning and AI system fields. Inspired by the concepts in trustworthy AI, we proposed the first trustworthy representation learning across domains framework which includes four concepts, i.e, robustness, privacy, fairness, and explainability, to give a comprehensive literature review on this research direction. Specifically, we first introduce the details of the proposed trustworthy framework for representation learning across domains. Second, we provide basic notions and comprehensively summarize existing methods for the trustworthy framework from four concepts. Finally, we conclude this survey with insights and discussions on future research directions.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We study the problem of best-arm identification with fixed budget in stochastic two-arm bandits with Bernoulli rewards. We prove that surprisingly, there is no algorithm that (i) performs as well as the algorithm sampling each arm equally (this algorithm is referred to as the {\it uniform sampling} algorithm) on all instances, and that (ii) strictly outperforms this algorithm on at least one instance. In short, there is no algorithm better than the uniform sampling algorithm. Towards this result, we introduce the natural class of {\it consistent} and {\it stable} algorithms, and show that any algorithm that performs as well as the uniform sampling algorithm on all instances belongs to this class. The proof is completed by deriving a lower bound on the error rate satisfied by any consistent and stable algorithm, and by showing that the uniform sampling algorithm matches this lower bound. Our results provide a solution to the two open problems presented in \cite{qin2022open}.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The design of interpretable deep learning models working in relational domains poses an open challenge: interpretable deep learning methods, such as Concept-Based Models (CBMs), are not designed to solve relational problems, while relational models are not as interpretable as CBMs. To address this problem, we propose Relational Concept-Based Models, a family of relational deep learning methods providing interpretable task predictions. Our experiments, ranging from image classification to link prediction in knowledge graphs, show that relational CBMs (i) match generalization performance of existing relational black-boxes (as opposed to non-relational CBMs), (ii) support the generation of quantified concept-based explanations, (iii) effectively respond to test-time interventions, and (iv) withstand demanding settings including out-of-distribution scenarios, limited training data regimes, and scarce concept supervisions.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Graph generation poses a significant challenge as it involves predicting a complete graph with multiple nodes and edges based on simply a given label. This task also carries fundamental importance to numerous real-world applications, including de-novo drug and molecular design. In recent years, several successful methods have emerged in the field of graph generation. However, these approaches suffer from two significant shortcomings: (1) the underlying Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures used in these methods are often underexplored; and (2) these methods are often evaluated on only a limited number of metrics. To fill this gap, we investigate the expressiveness of GNNs under the context of the molecular graph generation task, by replacing the underlying GNNs of graph generative models with more expressive GNNs. Specifically, we analyse the performance of six GNNs in two different generative frameworks (GCPN and GraphAF), on six different molecular generative objectives on the ZINC-250k dataset. Through our extensive experiments, we demonstrate that advanced GNNs can indeed improve the performance of GCPN and GraphAF on molecular generation tasks, but GNN expressiveness is not a necessary condition for a good GNN-based generative model. Moreover, we show that GCPN and GraphAF with advanced GNNs can achieve state-of-the-art results across 17 other non-GNN-based graph generative approaches, such as variational autoencoders and Bayesian optimisation models, on the proposed molecular generative objectives (DRD2, Median1, Median2), which are important metrics for de-novo molecular design.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Score-based explainable machine-learning techniques are often used to understand the logic behind black-box models. However, such explanation techniques are often computationally expensive, which limits their application in time-critical contexts. Therefore, we propose and investigate the use of computationally less costly regression models for approximating the output of score-based explanation techniques, such as SHAP. Moreover, validity guarantees for the approximated values are provided by the employed inductive conformal prediction framework. We propose several non-conformity measures designed to take the difficulty of approximating the explanations into account while keeping the computational cost low. We present results from a large-scale empirical investigation, in which the approximate explanations generated by our proposed models are evaluated with respect to efficiency (interval size). The results indicate that the proposed method can significantly improve execution time compared to the fast version of SHAP, TreeSHAP. The results also suggest that the proposed method can produce tight intervals, while providing validity guarantees. Moreover, the proposed approach allows for comparing explanations of different approximation methods and selecting a method based on how informative (tight) are the predicted intervals.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Building scalable vision-language models to learn from diverse, multimodal data remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce an Efficient Vision-languagE foundation model, namely EVE, which is one unified multimodal Transformer pre-trained solely by one unified pre-training task. Specifically, EVE encodes both vision and language within a shared Transformer network integrated with modality-aware sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) modules, which capture modality-specific information by selectively switching to different experts. To unify pre-training tasks of vision and language, EVE performs masked signal modeling on image-text pairs to reconstruct masked signals, i.e., image pixels and text tokens, given visible signals. This simple yet effective pre-training objective accelerates training by 3.5x compared to the model pre-trained with Image-Text Contrastive and Image-Text Matching losses. Owing to the combination of the unified architecture and pre-training task, EVE is easy to scale up, enabling better downstream performance with fewer resources and faster training speed. Despite its simplicity, EVE achieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language downstream tasks, including visual question answering, visual reasoning, and image-text retrieval.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The burden of liver tumors is important, ranking as the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality. In case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the delineation of liver and tumor on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) is performed to guide the treatment strategy. As this task is time-consuming, needs high expertise and could be subject to inter-observer variability there is a strong need for automatic tools. However, challenges arise from the lack of available training data, as well as the high variability in terms of image resolution and MRI sequence. In this work we propose to compare two different pipelines based on anisotropic models to obtain the segmentation of the liver and tumors. The first pipeline corresponds to a baseline multi-class model that performs the simultaneous segmentation of the liver and tumor classes. In the second approach, we train two distinct binary models, one segmenting the liver only and the other the tumors. Our results show that both pipelines exhibit different strengths and weaknesses. Moreover we propose an uncertainty quantification strategy allowing the identification of potential false positive tumor lesions. Both solutions were submitted to the MICCAI 2023 Atlas challenge regarding liver and tumor segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In continual learning, plasticity refers to the ability of an agent to quickly adapt to new information. Neural networks are known to lose plasticity when processing non-stationary data streams. In this paper, we propose L2 Init, a very simple approach for maintaining plasticity by incorporating in the loss function L2 regularization toward initial parameters. This is very similar to standard L2 regularization (L2), the only difference being that L2 regularizes toward the origin. L2 Init is simple to implement and requires selecting only a single hyper-parameter. The motivation for this method is the same as that of methods that reset neurons or parameter values. Intuitively, when recent losses are insensitive to particular parameters, these parameters drift toward their initial values. This prepares parameters to adapt quickly to new tasks. On simple problems representative of different types of nonstationarity in continual learning, we demonstrate that L2 Init consistently mitigates plasticity loss. We additionally find that our regularization term reduces parameter magnitudes and maintains a high effective feature rank.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients (e.g., edge devices) without sharing raw data. Yet, FL can be computationally expensive as the clients need to train the entire model multiple times. SplitFed learning (SFL) is a recent distributed approach that alleviates computation workload at the client device by splitting the model at a cut layer into two parts, where clients only need to train part of the model. However, SFL still suffers from the \textit{client drift} problem when clients’ data are highly non-IID. To address this issue, we propose MiniBatch-SFL. This algorithm incorporates MiniBatch SGD into SFL, where the clients train the client-side model in an FL fashion while the server trains the server-side model similar to MiniBatch SGD. We analyze the convergence of MiniBatch-SFL and show that the bound of the expected loss can be obtained by analyzing the expected server-side and client-side model updates, respectively. The server-side updates do not depend on the non-IID degree of the clients’ datasets and can potentially mitigate client drift. However, the client-side model relies on the non-IID degree and can be optimized by properly choosing the cut layer. Perhaps counter-intuitive, our empirical result shows that a latter position of the cut layer leads to a smaller average gradient divergence and a better algorithm performance. Moreover, numerical results show that MiniBatch-SFL achieves higher accuracy than conventional SFL and FL. The accuracy improvement can be up to 24.1% and 17.1% with highly non-IID data, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting involves modeling temporal dependencies within historical records. Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in MTS forecasting due to their capability to capture long-term dependencies. However, prior work has been confined to modeling temporal dependencies at either a fixed scale or multiple scales that exponentially increase (most with base 2). This limitation hinders their effectiveness in capturing diverse seasonalities, such as hourly and daily patterns. In this paper, we introduce a dimension invariant embedding technique that captures short-term temporal dependencies and projects MTS data into a higher-dimensional space, while preserving the dimensions of time steps and variables in MTS data. Furthermore, we present a novel Multi-scale Transformer Pyramid Network (MTPNet), specifically designed to effectively capture temporal dependencies at multiple unconstrained scales. The predictions are inferred from multi-scale latent representations obtained from transformers at various scales. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MTPNet outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The Ramsey number is the minimum number of nodes, $n &#x3D; R(s, t)$, such that all undirected simple graphs of order $n$, contain a clique of order $s$, or an independent set of order $t$. This paper explores the application of a best first search algorithm and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to find counterexamples to specific Ramsey numbers. We incrementally improve over prior search methods such as random search by introducing a graph vectorization and deep neural network (DNN)-based heuristic, which gauge the likelihood of a graph being a counterexample. The paper also proposes algorithmic optimizations to confine a polynomial search runtime. This paper does not aim to present new counterexamples but rather introduces and evaluates a framework supporting Ramsey counterexample exploration using other heuristics. Code and methods are made available through a PyPI package and GitHub repository.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Text-based audio generation models have limitations as they cannot encompass all the information in audio, leading to restricted controllability when relying solely on text. To address this issue, we propose a novel model that enhances the controllability of existing pre-trained text-to-audio models by incorporating additional conditions including content (timestamp) and style (pitch contour and energy contour) as supplements to the text. This approach achieves fine-grained control over the temporal order, pitch, and energy of generated audio. To preserve the diversity of generation, we employ a trainable control condition encoder that is enhanced by a large language model and a trainable Fusion-Net to encode and fuse the additional conditions while keeping the weights of the pre-trained text-to-audio model frozen. Due to the lack of suitable datasets and evaluation metrics, we consolidate existing datasets into a new dataset comprising the audio and corresponding conditions and use a series of evaluation metrics to evaluate the controllability performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our model successfully achieves fine-grained control to accomplish controllable audio generation.

<p>Abstract:<br>Accurate demand forecasting in the retail industry is a critical determinant of financial performance and supply chain efficiency. As global markets become increasingly interconnected, businesses are turning towards advanced prediction models to gain a competitive edge. However, existing literature mostly focuses on historical sales data and ignores the vital influence of macroeconomic conditions on consumer spending behavior. In this study, we bridge this gap by enriching time series data of customer demand with macroeconomic variables, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS), and unemployment rates. Leveraging this comprehensive dataset, we develop and compare various regression and machine learning models to predict retail demand accurately.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The problem of system identification for the Kalman filter, relying on the expectation-maximization (EM) procedure to learn the underlying parameters of a dynamical system, has largely been studied assuming that observations are sampled at equally-spaced time points. However, in many applications this is a restrictive and unrealistic assumption. This paper addresses system identification for the continuous-discrete filter, with the aim of generalizing learning for the Kalman filter by relying on a solution to a continuous-time It^o stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the latent state and covariance dynamics. We introduce a novel two-filter, analytical form for the posterior with a Bayesian derivation, which yields analytical updates which do not require the forward-pass to be pre-computed. Using this analytical and efficient computation of the posterior, we provide an EM procedure which estimates the parameters of the SDE, naturally incorporating irregularly sampled measurements. Generalizing the learning of latent linear dynamical systems (LDS) to continuous-time may extend the use of the hybrid Kalman filter to data which is not regularly sampled or has intermittent missing values, and can extend the power of non-linear system identification methods such as switching LDS (SLDS), which rely on EM for the linear discrete-time Kalman filter as a sub-unit for learning locally linearized behavior of a non-linear system. We apply the method by learning the parameters of a latent, multivariate Fokker-Planck SDE representing a toggle-switch genetic circuit using biologically realistic parameters, and compare the efficacy of learning relative to the discrete-time Kalman filter as the step-size irregularity and spectral-radius of the dynamics-matrix increases.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Landslide susceptibility assessment (LSA) is of paramount importance in mitigating landslide risks. Recently, there has been a surge in the utilization of data-driven methods for predicting landslide susceptibility due to the growing availability of aerial and satellite data. Nonetheless, the rapid oscillations within the landslide-inducing environment (LIE), primarily due to significant changes in external triggers such as rainfall, pose difficulties for contemporary data-driven LSA methodologies to accommodate LIEs over diverse timespans. This study presents dynamic landslide susceptibility mapping that simply employs multiple predictive models for annual LSA. In practice, this will inevitably encounter small sample problems due to the limited number of landslide samples in certain years. Another concern arises owing to the majority of the existing LSA approaches train black-box models to fit distinct datasets, yet often failing in generalization and providing comprehensive explanations concerning the interactions between input features and predictions. Accordingly, we proposed to meta-learn representations with fast adaptation ability using a few samples and gradient updates; and apply SHAP for each model interpretation and landslide feature permutation. Additionally, we applied MT-InSAR for LSA result enhancement and validation. The chosen study area is Lantau Island, Hong Kong, where we conducted a comprehensive dynamic LSA spanning from 1992 to 2019. The model interpretation results demonstrate that the primary factors responsible for triggering landslides in Lantau Island are terrain slope and extreme rainfall. The results also indicate that the variation in landslide causes can be primarily attributed to extreme rainfall events, which result from global climate change, and the implementation of the Landslip Prevention and Mitigation Programme (LPMitP) by the Hong Kong government.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In this work, we present and analyze a numerical solver for optimal control problems (without &#x2F; with box constraint) for linear and semilinear second-order elliptic problems. The approach is based on a coupled system derived from the first-order optimality system of the optimal control problem, and applies physics informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve the coupled system. We present an error analysis of the numerical scheme, and provide $L^2(\Omega)$ error bounds on the state, control and adjoint state in terms of deep neural network parameters (e.g., depth, width, and parameter bounds) and the number of sampling points in the domain and on the boundary. The main tools in the analysis include offset Rademacher complexity and boundedness and Lipschitz continuity of neural network functions. We present several numerical examples to illustrate the approach and compare it with three existing approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Reinforcement learning has achieved great success in many decision-making tasks, and traditional reinforcement learning algorithms are mainly designed for obtaining a single optimal solution. However, recent works show the importance of developing diverse policies, which makes it an emerging research topic. Despite the variety of diversity reinforcement learning algorithms that have emerged, none of them theoretically answer the question of how the algorithm converges and how efficient the algorithm is. In this paper, we provide a unified diversity reinforcement learning framework and investigate the convergence of training diverse policies. Under such a framework, we also propose a provably efficient diversity reinforcement learning algorithm. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of our method through numerical experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We proposed Audio Difference Captioning (ADC) as a new extension task of audio captioning for describing the semantic differences between input pairs of similar but slightly different audio clips. The ADC solves the problem that conventional audio captioning sometimes generates similar captions for similar audio clips, failing to describe the difference in content. We also propose a cross-attention-concentrated transformer encoder to extract differences by comparing a pair of audio clips and a similarity-discrepancy disentanglement to emphasize the difference in the latent space. To evaluate the proposed methods, we built an AudioDiffCaps dataset consisting of pairs of similar but slightly different audio clips with human-annotated descriptions of their differences. The experiment with the AudioDiffCaps dataset showed that the proposed methods solve the ADC task effectively and improve the attention weights to extract the difference by visualizing them in the transformer encoder.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) is a widely used, efficient test mode that adapts to the examinee’s proficiency level in the test domain. CAT requires pre-trained item profiles, for CAT iteratively assesses the student real-time based on the registered items’ profiles, and selects the next item to administer using candidate items’ profiles. However, obtaining such item profiles is a costly process that involves gathering a large, dense item-response data, then training a diagnostic model on the collected data. In this paper, we explore the possibility of leveraging response data collected in the CAT service. We first show that this poses a unique challenge due to the inherent selection bias introduced by CAT, i.e., more proficient students will receive harder questions. Indeed, when naively training the diagnostic model using CAT response data, we observe that item profiles deviate significantly from the ground-truth. To tackle the selection bias issue, we propose the user-wise aggregate influence function method. Our intuition is to filter out users whose response data is heavily biased in an aggregate manner, as judged by how much perturbation the added data will introduce during parameter estimation. This way, we may enhance the performance of CAT while introducing minimal bias to the item profiles. We provide extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method based on the three public datasets and one dataset that contains real-world CAT response data.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Decision-making problems can be represented as mathematical optimization models, finding wide applications in fields such as economics, engineering and manufacturing, transportation, and health care. Optimization models are mathematical abstractions of the problem of making the best decision while satisfying a set of requirements or constraints. One of the primary barriers to deploying these models in practice is the challenge of helping practitioners understand and interpret such models, particularly when they are infeasible, meaning no decision satisfies all the constraints. Existing methods for diagnosing infeasible optimization models often rely on expert systems, necessitating significant background knowledge in optimization. In this paper, we introduce OptiChat, a first-of-its-kind natural language-based system equipped with a chatbot GUI for engaging in interactive conversations about infeasible optimization models. OptiChat can provide natural language descriptions of the optimization model itself, identify potential sources of infeasibility, and offer suggestions to make the model feasible. The implementation of OptiChat is built on GPT-4, which interfaces with an optimization solver to identify the minimal subset of constraints that render the entire optimization problem infeasible, also known as the Irreducible Infeasible Subset (IIS). We utilize few-shot learning, expert chain-of-thought, key-retrieve, and sentiment prompts to enhance OptiChat’s reliability. Our experiments demonstrate that OptiChat assists both expert and non-expert users in improving their understanding of the optimization models, enabling them to quickly identify the sources of infeasibility.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>While learning a heuristic function for forward search algorithms with modern machine learning techniques has been gaining interest in recent years, there has been little theoretical understanding of \emph{what} they should learn, \emph{how} to train them, and \emph{why} we do so. This lack of understanding leads to various literature performing an ad-hoc selection of datasets (suboptimal vs optimal costs or admissible vs inadmissible heuristics) and optimization metrics (e.g., squared vs absolute errors). Moreover, due to the lack of admissibility of the resulting trained heuristics, little focus has been put on the role of admissibility \emph{during} learning. This paper articulates the role of admissible heuristics in supervised heuristic learning using them as parameters of Truncated Gaussian distributions, which tightens the hypothesis space compared to ordinary Gaussian distributions. We argue that this mathematical model faithfully follows the principle of maximum entropy and empirically show that, as a result, it yields more accurate heuristics and converges faster during training.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Studies on semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) have seen fast progress recently. Due to the limited labelled data, SSMIS methods mainly focus on effectively leveraging unlabeled data to enhance the segmentation performance. However, despite their promising performance, current state-of-the-art methods often prioritize integrating complex techniques and loss terms rather than addressing the core challenges of semi-supervised scenarios directly. We argue that the key to SSMIS lies in generating substantial and appropriate prediction disagreement on unlabeled data. To this end, we emphasize the crutiality of data perturbation and model stabilization in semi-supervised segmentation, and propose a simple yet effective approach to boost SSMIS performance significantly, dubbed DPMS. Specifically, we first revisit SSMIS from three distinct perspectives: the data, the model, and the loss, and conduct a comprehensive study of corresponding strategies to examine their effectiveness. Based on these examinations, we then propose DPMS, which adopts a plain teacher-student framework with a standard supervised loss and unsupervised consistency loss. To produce appropriate prediction disagreements, DPMS perturbs the unlabeled data via strong augmentations to enlarge prediction disagreements considerably. On the other hand, using EMA teacher when strong augmentation is applied does not necessarily improve performance. DPMS further utilizes a forwarding-twice and momentum updating strategies for normalization statistics to stabilize the training on unlabeled data effectively. Despite its simplicity, DPMS can obtain new state-of-the-art performance on the public 2D ACDC and 3D LA datasets across various semi-supervised settings, e.g. obtaining a remarkable 22.62% improvement against previous SOTA on ACDC with 5% labels.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Ligand-based drug design aims to identify novel drug candidates of similar shapes with known active molecules. In this paper, we formulated an in silico shape-conditioned molecule generation problem to generate 3D molecule structures conditioned on the shape of a given molecule. To address this problem, we developed a translation- and rotation-equivariant shape-guided generative model ShapeMol. ShapeMol consists of an equivariant shape encoder that maps molecular surface shapes into latent embeddings, and an equivariant diffusion model that generates 3D molecules based on these embeddings. Experimental results show that ShapeMol can generate novel, diverse, drug-like molecules that retain 3D molecular shapes similar to the given shape condition. These results demonstrate the potential of ShapeMol in designing drug candidates of desired 3D shapes binding to protein target pockets.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Deep neural networks (DNN) have found wide applicability in numerous fields due to their ability to accurately learn very complex input-output relations. Despite their accuracy and extensive use, DNNs are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks due to limited generalizability. For future progress in the field, it is essential to build DNNs that are robust to any kind of perturbations to the data points. In the past, many techniques have been proposed to robustify DNNs using first-order derivative information of the network.   This paper proposes a new robustification approach based on control theory. A neural network architecture that incorporates feedback control, named Feedback Neural Networks, is proposed. The controller is itself a neural network, which is trained using regular and adversarial data such as to stabilize the system outputs. The novel adversarial training approach based on the feedback control architecture is called Feedback Looped Adversarial Training (FLAT). Numerical results on standard test problems empirically show that our FLAT method is more effective than the state-of-the-art to guard against adversarial attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Scene understanding using multi-modal data is necessary in many applications, e.g., autonomous navigation. To achieve this in a variety of situations, existing models must be able to adapt to shifting data distributions without arduous data annotation. Current approaches assume that the source data is available during adaptation and that the source consists of paired multi-modal data. Both these assumptions may be problematic for many applications. Source data may not be available due to privacy, security, or economic concerns. Assuming the existence of paired multi-modal data for training also entails significant data collection costs and fails to take advantage of widely available freely distributed pre-trained uni-modal models. In this work, we relax both of these assumptions by addressing the problem of adapting a set of models trained independently on uni-modal data to a target domain consisting of unlabeled multi-modal data, without having access to the original source dataset. Our proposed approach solves this problem through a switching framework which automatically chooses between two complementary methods of cross-modal pseudo-label fusion – agreement filtering and entropy weighting – based on the estimated domain gap. We demonstrate our work on the semantic segmentation problem. Experiments across seven challenging adaptation scenarios verify the efficacy of our approach, achieving results comparable to, and in some cases outperforming, methods which assume access to source data. Our method achieves an improvement in mIoU of up to 12% over competing baselines.

<p>Abstract:<br>The strategy of training the model from scratch in a specific language or domain serves two essential purposes: i) enhancing performance in the particular linguistic or domain context, and ii) ensuring effective tokenization. The main limitation inherent to this approach lies in the associated cost, which can reach six to seven-digit dollar values, depending on the model size and the number of parameters involved.   The main solution to overcome the cost challenge is to rely on available pre-trained models, which, despite recent advancements such as the LLaMA and LLaMA-2 models, still demonstrate inefficiency for certain specific domain problems or prove ineffective in scenarios involving conversational memory resources, given the large number of tokens required to represent text.   To overcome this issue, we present a methodology named Cabrita, which, as our research demonstrates, successfully addresses the performance and efficient tokenization problem, all at an affordable cost. We believe that this methodology can be applied to any transformer-like architecture model. To validate the study, we conducted continuous pre-training exclusively using Portuguese text on a 3-billion-parameter model known as OpenLLaMA, resulting in a model named openCabrita 3B. The openCabrita 3B also features a new tokenizer that results in a significant reduction in the number of tokens required to represent the text. In our assessment, for few-shot learning tasks, we achieved similar results with this 3B model compared to a traditional continuous pre-training approach as well as to 7B models English pre-trained models.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper introduces a method for Large Language Models (LLM) to produce enhanced compiler error explanations, in simple language, within our Debugging C Compiler (DCC). It is well documented that compiler error messages have been known to present a barrier for novices learning how to program. Although our initial use of DCC in introductory programming (CS1) has been instrumental in teaching C to novice programmers by providing safeguards to commonly occurring errors and translating the usually cryptic compiler error messages at both compile- and run-time, we proposed that incorporating LLM-generated explanations would further enhance the learning experience for novice programmers. Through an expert evaluation, we observed that LLM-generated explanations for compiler errors were conceptually accurate in 90% of compile-time errors, and 75% of run-time errors. Additionally, the new DCC-help tool has been increasingly adopted by students, with an average of 1047 unique runs per week, demonstrating a promising initial assessment of using LLMs to complement compiler output to enhance programming education for beginners. We release our tool as open-source to the community.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>NPN classification has many applications in the synthesis and verification of digital circuits. The canonical-form-based method is the most common approach, designing a canonical form as representative for the NPN equivalence class first and then computing the transformation function according to the canonical form. Most works use variable symmetries and several signatures, mainly based on the cofactor, to simplify the canonical form construction and computation. This paper describes a novel canonical form and its computation algorithm by introducing Boolean influence to NPN classification, which is a basic concept in analysis of Boolean functions. We show that influence is input-negation-independent, input-permutation-dependent, and has other structural information than previous signatures for NPN classification. Therefore, it is a significant ingredient in speeding up NPN classification. Experimental results prove that influence plays an important role in reducing the transformation enumeration in computing the canonical form. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithm implemented in ABC, our influence-aided canonical form for exact NPN classification gains up to 5.5x speedup.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Despite recent availability of large transcribed Kinyarwanda speech data, achieving robust speech recognition for Kinyarwanda is still challenging. In this work, we show that using self-supervised pre-training, following a simple curriculum schedule during fine-tuning and using semi-supervised learning to leverage large unlabelled speech data significantly improve speech recognition performance for Kinyarwanda. Our approach focuses on using public domain data only. A new studio-quality speech dataset is collected from a public website, then used to train a clean baseline model. The clean baseline model is then used to rank examples from a more diverse and noisy public dataset, defining a simple curriculum training schedule. Finally, we apply semi-supervised learning to label and learn from large unlabelled data in four successive generations. Our final model achieves 3.2% word error rate (WER) on the new dataset and 15.9% WER on Mozilla Common Voice benchmark, which is state-of-the-art to the best of our knowledge. Our experiments also indicate that using syllabic rather than character-based tokenization results in better speech recognition performance for Kinyarwanda.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Climate projections using data driven machine learning models acting as emulators, is one of the prevailing areas of research to enable policy makers make informed decisions. Use of machine learning emulators as surrogates for computationally heavy GCM simulators reduces time and carbon footprints. In this direction, ClimateBench [1] is a recently curated benchmarking dataset for evaluating the performance of machine learning emulators designed for climate data. Recent studies have reported that despite being considered fundamental, regression models offer several advantages pertaining to climate emulations. In particular, by leveraging the kernel trick, regression models can capture complex relationships and improve their predictive capabilities. This study focuses on evaluating non-linear regression models using the aforementioned dataset. Specifically, we compare the emulation capabilities of three non-linear regression models. Among them, Gaussian Process Regressor demonstrates the best-in-class performance against standard evaluation metrics used for climate field emulation studies. However, Gaussian Process Regression suffers from being computational resource hungry in terms of space and time complexity. Alternatively, Support Vector and Kernel Ridge models also deliver competitive results and but there are certain trade-offs to be addressed. Additionally, we are actively investigating the performance of composite kernels and techniques such as variational inference to further enhance the performance of the regression models and effectively model complex non-linear patterns, including phenomena like precipitation.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Real-time railway rescheduling is a timely and flexible technique to automatically alter the operation schedule in response to time-varying conditions. Current research lacks data-driven approaches that capture real-time passenger mobility during railway disruptions, relying mostly on OD-based data and model-based methods for estimating demands of trains. Meanwhile, the schedule-updating principles for a long-term disruption overlook the uneven distribution of demand over time. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a demand-responsive approach by inferring real-world passenger mobility from mobile data (MD) to facilitate real-time rescheduling. Unlike network-level approaches, this paper focuses on a heavy-demand station upstream of the disrupted area. The objective is to reschedule all trains on multiple routes passing through this target station, which have been affected by a severe emergency event such as a natural disaster. Particular attention should be given to avoiding the accumulation of overcrowded passengers at this station, to prevent additional accidents arising from overcrowding. This research addresses the challenges associated with this scenario, including the dynamics of arriving and leaving of passengers, station overcrowding, rolling stock shortage, open-ended disruption duration, integrated rescheduling on multiple routes, and delays due to detours. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework is proposed to determine the optimal rescheduled timetable, route stops, and rolling stock allocation, while considering real-time demand satisfaction, station overcrowding, train capacity utilization, and headway safety.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Machine Learning (ML) systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples, particularly those from query-based black-box attacks. Despite various efforts to detect and prevent such attacks, there is a need for a more comprehensive approach to logging, analyzing, and sharing evidence of attacks. While classic security benefits from well-established forensics and intelligence sharing, Machine Learning is yet to find a way to profile its attackers and share information about them. In response, this paper introduces SEA, a novel ML security system to characterize black-box attacks on ML systems for forensic purposes and to facilitate human-explainable intelligence sharing. SEA leverages the Hidden Markov Models framework to attribute the observed query sequence to known attacks. It thus understands the attack’s progression rather than just focusing on the final adversarial examples. Our evaluations reveal that SEA is effective at attack attribution, even on their second occurrence, and is robust to adaptive strategies designed to evade forensics analysis. Interestingly, SEA’s explanations of the attack behavior allow us even to fingerprint specific minor implementation bugs in attack libraries. For example, we discover that the SignOPT and Square attacks implementation in ART v1.14 sends over 50% specific zero difference queries. We thoroughly evaluate SEA on a variety of settings and demonstrate that it can recognize the same attack’s second occurrence with 90+% Top-1 and 95+% Top-3 accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Identification and analysis of symmetrical patterns in the natural world have led to significant discoveries across various scientific fields, such as the formulation of gravitational laws in physics and advancements in the study of chemical structures. In this paper, we focus on exploiting Euclidean symmetries inherent in certain cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problems and prevalent in many applications. We begin by formally characterizing a subclass of Markov games with a general notion of symmetries that admits the existence of symmetric optimal values and policies. Motivated by these properties, we design neural network architectures with symmetric constraints embedded as an inductive bias for multi-agent actor-critic methods. This inductive bias results in superior performance in various cooperative MARL benchmarks and impressive generalization capabilities such as zero-shot learning and transfer learning in unseen scenarios with repeated symmetric patterns.

<p>Abstract:<br>Evaluation is a systematic approach to assessing how well a system achieves its intended purpose. Federated learning (FL) is a novel paradigm for privacy-preserving machine learning that allows multiple parties to collaboratively train models without sharing sensitive data. However, evaluating FL is challenging due to its interdisciplinary nature and diverse goals, such as utility, efficiency, and security. In this survey, we first review the major evaluation goals adopted in the existing studies and then explore the evaluation metrics used for each goal. We also introduce FedEval, an open-source platform that provides a standardized and comprehensive evaluation framework for FL algorithms in terms of their utility, efficiency, and security. Finally, we discuss several challenges and future research directions for FL evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Deep neural networks are increasingly utilized in various machine learning tasks. However, as these models grow in complexity, they often face calibration issues, despite enhanced prediction accuracy. Many studies have endeavored to improve calibration performance through data preprocessing, the use of specific loss functions, and training frameworks. Yet, investigations into calibration properties have been somewhat overlooked. Our study leverages the Neural Architecture Search (NAS) search space, offering an exhaustive model architecture space for thorough calibration properties exploration. We specifically create a model calibration dataset. This dataset evaluates 90 bin-based and 12 additional calibration measurements across 117,702 unique neural networks within the widely employed NATS-Bench search space. Our analysis aims to answer several longstanding questions in the field, using our proposed dataset: (i) Can model calibration be generalized across different tasks? (ii) Can robustness be used as a calibration measurement? (iii) How reliable are calibration metrics? (iv) Does a post-hoc calibration method affect all models uniformly? (v) How does calibration interact with accuracy? (vi) What is the impact of bin size on calibration measurement? (vii) Which architectural designs are beneficial for calibration? Additionally, our study bridges an existing gap by exploring calibration within NAS. By providing this dataset, we enable further research into NAS calibration. As far as we are aware, our research represents the first large-scale investigation into calibration properties and the premier study of calibration issues within NAS.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Early brain development is characterized by the formation of a highly organized structural connectome. The interconnected nature of this connectome underlies the brain’s cognitive abilities and influences its response to diseases and environmental factors. Hence, quantitative assessment of structural connectivity in the perinatal stage is useful for studying normal and abnormal neurodevelopment. However, estimation of the connectome from diffusion MRI data involves complex computations. For the perinatal period, these computations are further challenged by the rapid brain development and imaging difficulties. Combined with high inter-subject variability, these factors make it difficult to chart the normal development of the structural connectome. As a result, there is a lack of reliable normative baselines of structural connectivity metrics at this critical stage in brain development. In this study, we developed a computational framework, based on spatio-temporal averaging, for determining such baselines. We used this framework to analyze the structural connectivity between 33 and 44 postmenstrual weeks using data from 166 subjects. Our results unveiled clear and strong trends in the development of structural connectivity in perinatal stage. Connection weighting based on fractional anisotropy and neurite density produced the most consistent results. We observed increases in global and local efficiency, a decrease in characteristic path length, and widespread strengthening of the connections within and across brain lobes and hemispheres. We also observed asymmetry patterns that were consistent between different connection weighting approaches. The new computational method and results are useful for assessing normal and abnormal development of the structural connectome early in life.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Bayesian classifiers perform well when each of the features is completely independent of the other which is not always valid in real world application. The aim of this study is to implement and compare the performances of each variant of Bayesian classifier (Multinomial, Bernoulli, and Gaussian) on anomaly detection in network intrusion, and to investigate whether there is any association between each variant assumption and their performance. Our investigation showed that each variant of Bayesian algorithm blindly follows its assumption regardless of feature property, and that the assumption is the single most important factor that influences their accuracy. Experimental results show that Bernoulli has accuracy of 69.9% test (71% train), Multinomial has accuracy of 31.2% test (31.2% train), while Gaussian has accuracy of 81.69% test (82.84% train). Going deeper, we investigated and found that each Naive Bayes variants performances and accuracy is largely due to each classifier assumption, Gaussian classifier performed best on anomaly detection due to its assumption that features follow normal distributions which are continuous, while multinomial classifier have a dismal performance as it simply assumes discreet and multinomial distribution.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Large language models such as Open AI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models are proficient at answering questions, but their knowledge is confined to the information present in their training data. This limitation renders them ineffective when confronted with questions about recent developments or non-public documents. Our research proposes a method that enables GPT models to answer questions by employing context from an information source not previously included in their training data. The methodology includes preprocessing of contextual information, the embedding of contexts and queries, constructing prompt through the integration of context embeddings, and generating answers using GPT models. We applied this method in a controlled test scenario using the California Driver’s Handbook as the information source. The GPT-3 model achieved a 96% passing score on a set of 50 sample driving knowledge test questions. In contrast, without context, the model’s passing score fell to 82%. However, the model still fails to answer some questions correctly even with providing library of context, highlighting room for improvement. The research also examined the impact of prompt length and context format, on the model’s performance. Overall, the study provides insights into the limitations and potential improvements for GPT models in question-answering tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are pivotal in extracting latent information from graph data across various domains, yet their acceleration on mainstream GPUs is challenged by workload imbalance and memory access irregularity. To address these challenges, we present Accel-GCN, a GPU accelerator architecture for GCNs. The design of Accel-GCN encompasses: (i) a lightweight degree sorting stage to group nodes with similar degree; (ii) a block-level partition strategy that dynamically adjusts warp workload sizes, enhancing shared memory locality and workload balance, and reducing metadata overhead compared to designs like GNNAdvisor; (iii) a combined warp strategy that improves memory coalescing and computational parallelism in the column dimension of dense matrices.   Utilizing these principles, we formulated a kernel for sparse matrix multiplication (SpMM) in GCNs that employs block-level partitioning and combined warp strategy. This approach augments performance and multi-level memory efficiency and optimizes memory bandwidth by exploiting memory coalescing and alignment. Evaluation of Accel-GCN across 18 benchmark graphs reveals that it outperforms cuSPARSE, GNNAdvisor, and graph-BLAST by factors of 1.17 times, 1.86 times, and 2.94 times respectively. The results underscore Accel-GCN as an effective solution for enhancing GCN computational efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Backdoor attack is a major threat to deep learning systems in safety-critical scenarios, which aims to trigger misbehavior of neural network models under attacker-controlled conditions. However, most backdoor attacks have to modify the neural network models through training with poisoned data and&#x2F;or direct model editing, which leads to a common but false belief that backdoor attack can be easily avoided by properly protecting the model. In this paper, we show that backdoor attacks can be achieved without any model modification. Instead of injecting backdoor logic into the training data or the model, we propose to place a carefully-designed patch (namely backdoor patch) in front of the camera, which is fed into the model together with the input images. The patch can be trained to behave normally at most of the time, while producing wrong prediction when the input image contains an attacker-controlled trigger object. Our main techniques include an effective training method to generate the backdoor patch and a digital-physical transformation modeling method to enhance the feasibility of the patch in real deployments. Extensive experiments show that PatchBackdoor can be applied to common deep learning models (VGG, MobileNet, ResNet) with an attack success rate of 93% to 99% on classification tasks. Moreover, we implement PatchBackdoor in real-world scenarios and show that the attack is still threatening.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The fairness issue of clinical data modeling, especially on Electronic Health Records (EHRs), is of utmost importance due to EHR’s complex latent structure and potential selection bias. It is frequently necessary to mitigate health disparity while keeping the model’s overall accuracy in practice. However, traditional methods often encounter the trade-off between accuracy and fairness, as they fail to capture the underlying factors beyond observed data. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel model called Fair Longitudinal Medical Deconfounder (FLMD) that aims to achieve both fairness and accuracy in longitudinal Electronic Health Records (EHR) modeling. Drawing inspiration from the deconfounder theory, FLMD employs a two-stage training process. In the first stage, FLMD captures unobserved confounders for each encounter, which effectively represents underlying medical factors beyond observed EHR, such as patient genotypes and lifestyle habits. This unobserved confounder is crucial for addressing the accuracy&#x2F;fairness dilemma. In the second stage, FLMD combines the learned latent representation with other relevant features to make predictions. By incorporating appropriate fairness criteria, such as counterfactual fairness, FLMD ensures that it maintains high prediction accuracy while simultaneously minimizing health disparities. We conducted comprehensive experiments on two real-world EHR datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of FLMD. Apart from the comparison of baseline methods and FLMD variants in terms of fairness and accuracy, we assessed the performance of all models on disturbed&#x2F;imbalanced and synthetic datasets to showcase the superiority of FLMD across different settings and provide valuable insights into its capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This research contributes to the advancement of traffic state estimation methods by leveraging the benefits of the nonlocal LWR model within a physics-informed deep learning framework. The classical LWR model, while useful, falls short of accurately representing real-world traffic flows. The nonlocal LWR model addresses this limitation by considering the speed as a weighted mean of the downstream traffic density. In this paper, we propose a novel PIDL framework that incorporates the nonlocal LWR model. We introduce both fixed-length and variable-length kernels and develop the required mathematics. The proposed PIDL framework undergoes a comprehensive evaluation, including various convolutional kernels and look-ahead windows, using data from the NGSIM and CitySim datasets. The results demonstrate improvements over the baseline PIDL approach using the local LWR model. The findings highlight the potential of the proposed approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability of traffic state estimation, enabling more effective traffic management strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Data-driven, deep-learning modeling frameworks have been recently developed for forecasting time series data. Such machine learning models may be useful in multiple domains including the atmospheric and oceanic ones, and in general, the larger fluids community. The present work investigates the possible effectiveness of such deep neural operator models for reproducing and predicting classic fluid flows and simulations of realistic ocean dynamics. We first briefly evaluate the capabilities of such deep neural operator models when trained on a simulated two-dimensional fluid flow past a cylinder. We then investigate their application to forecasting ocean surface circulation in the Middle Atlantic Bight and Massachusetts Bay, learning from high-resolution data-assimilative simulations employed for real sea experiments. We confirm that trained deep neural operator models are capable of predicting idealized periodic eddy shedding. For realistic ocean surface flows and our preliminary study, they can predict several of the features and show some skill, providing potential for future research and applications.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Multi-modal encoders map images, sounds, texts, videos, etc. into a single embedding space, aligning representations across modalities (e.g., associate an image of a dog with a barking sound). We show that multi-modal embeddings can be vulnerable to an attack we call “adversarial illusions.” Given an input in any modality, an adversary can perturb it so as to make its embedding close to that of an arbitrary, adversary-chosen input in another modality. Illusions thus enable the adversary to align any image with any text, any text with any sound, etc.   Adversarial illusions exploit proximity in the embedding space and are thus agnostic to downstream tasks. Using ImageBind embeddings, we demonstrate how adversarially aligned inputs, generated without knowledge of specific downstream tasks, mislead image generation, text generation, and zero-shot classification.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) deployed to the real world are regularly subject to out-of-distribution (OoD) data, various types of noise, and shifting conceptual objectives. This paper proposes a framework for adapting to data distribution drift modeled by benchmark Continual Learning datasets. We develop and evaluate a method of Continual Learning that leverages uncertainty quantification from Bayesian Inference to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We expand on previous approaches by removing the need for Monte Carlo sampling of the model weights to sample the predictive distribution. We optimize a closed-form Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) objective approximating the predictive distribution by propagating the first two moments of a distribution, i.e. mean and covariance, through all network layers. Catastrophic forgetting is mitigated by using the closed-form ELBO to approximate the Minimum Description Length (MDL) Principle, inherently penalizing changes in the model likelihood by minimizing the KL Divergence between the variational posterior for the current task and the previous task’s variational posterior acting as the prior. Leveraging the approximation of the MDL principle, we aim to initially learn a sparse variational posterior and then minimize additional model complexity learned for subsequent tasks. Our approach is evaluated for the task incremental learning scenario using density propagated versions of fully-connected and convolutional neural networks across multiple sequential benchmark datasets with varying task sequence lengths. Ultimately, this procedure produces a minimally complex network over a series of tasks mitigating catastrophic forgetting.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Current anti-spoofing and audio deepfake detection systems use either magnitude spectrogram-based features (such as CQT or Melspectrograms) or raw audio processed through convolution or sinc-layers. Both methods have drawbacks: magnitude spectrograms discard phase information, which affects audio naturalness, and raw-feature-based models cannot use traditional explainable AI methods. This paper proposes a new approach that combines the benefits of both methods by using complex-valued neural networks to process the complex-valued, CQT frequency-domain representation of the input audio. This method retains phase information and allows for explainable AI methods. Results show that this approach outperforms previous methods on the “In-the-Wild” anti-spoofing dataset and enables interpretation of the results through explainable AI. Ablation studies confirm that the model has learned to use phase information to detect voice spoofing.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Selecting the right resources for big data analytics jobs is hard because of the wide variety of configuration options like machine type and cluster size. As poor choices can have a significant impact on resource efficiency, cost, and energy usage, automated approaches are gaining popularity. Most existing methods rely on profiling recurring workloads to find near-optimal solutions over time. Due to the cold-start problem, this often leads to lengthy and costly profiling phases. However, big data analytics jobs across users can share many common properties: they often operate on similar infrastructure, using similar algorithms implemented in similar frameworks. The potential in sharing aggregated profiling runs to collaboratively address the cold start problem is largely unexplored.   We present Karasu, an approach to more efficient resource configuration profiling that promotes data sharing among users working with similar infrastructures, frameworks, algorithms, or datasets. Karasu trains lightweight performance models using aggregated runtime information of collaborators and combines them into an ensemble method to exploit inherent knowledge of the configuration search space. Moreover, Karasu allows the optimization of multiple objectives simultaneously. Our evaluation is based on performance data from diverse workload executions in a public cloud environment. We show that Karasu is able to significantly boost existing methods in terms of performance, search time, and cost, even when few comparable profiling runs are available that share only partial common characteristics with the target job.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Robotics and automation offer massive accelerations for solving intractable, multivariate scientific problems such as materials discovery, but the available search spaces can be dauntingly large. Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged as a popular sample-efficient optimization engine, thriving in tasks where no analytic form of the target function&#x2F;property is known. Here we exploit expert human knowledge in the form of hypotheses to direct Bayesian searches more quickly to promising regions of chemical space. Previous methods have used underlying distributions derived from existing experimental measurements, which is unfeasible for new, unexplored scientific tasks. Also, such distributions cannot capture intricate hypotheses. Our proposed method, which we call HypBO, uses expert human hypotheses to generate an improved seed of samples. Unpromising seeds are automatically discounted, while promising seeds are used to augment the surrogate model data, thus achieving better-informed sampling. This process continues in a global versus local search fashion, organized in a bilevel optimization framework. We validate the performance of our method on a range of synthetic functions and demonstrate its practical utility on a real chemical design task where the use of expert hypotheses accelerates the search performance significantly.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Absolute camera pose regressors estimate the position and orientation of a camera given the captured image alone. Typically, a convolutional backbone with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head is trained using images and pose labels to embed a single reference scene at a time. Recently, this scheme was extended to learn multiple scenes by replacing the MLP head with a set of fully connected layers. In this work, we propose to learn multi-scene absolute camera pose regression with Transformers, where encoders are used to aggregate activation maps with self-attention and decoders transform latent features and scenes encoding into pose predictions. This allows our model to focus on general features that are informative for localization, while embedding multiple scenes in parallel. We extend our previous MS-Transformer approach \cite{shavit2021learning} by introducing a mixed classification-regression architecture that improves the localization accuracy. Our method is evaluated on commonly benchmark indoor and outdoor datasets and has been shown to exceed both multi-scene and state-of-the-art single-scene absolute pose regressors.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We propose a novel framework for incorporating qualitative data into quantitative models for causal estimation. Previous methods use categorical variables derived from qualitative data to build quantitative models. However, this approach can lead to data-sparse categories and yield inconsistent (asymptotically biased) and imprecise (finite sample biased) estimates if the qualitative information is dynamic and intricate. We use functional analysis to create a more nuanced and flexible framework. We embed the observed categories into a latent Baire space and introduce a continuous linear map – a Hilbert space embedding – from the Baire space of categories to a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) of representation functions. Through the Riesz representation theorem, we establish that the canonical treatment of categorical variables in causal models can be transformed into an identified structure in the RKHS. Transfer learning acts as a catalyst to streamline estimation – embeddings from traditional models are paired with the kernel trick to form the Hilbert space embedding. We validate our model through comprehensive simulation evidence and demonstrate its relevance in a real-world study that contrasts theoretical predictions from economics and psychology in an e-commerce marketplace. The results confirm the superior performance of our model, particularly in scenarios where qualitative information is nuanced and complex.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Most current methods for detecting anomalies in text concentrate on constructing models solely relying on unlabeled data. These models operate on the presumption that no labeled anomalous examples are available, which prevents them from utilizing prior knowledge of anomalies that are typically present in small numbers in many real-world applications. Furthermore, these models prioritize learning feature embeddings rather than optimizing anomaly scores directly, which could lead to suboptimal anomaly scoring and inefficient use of data during the learning process. In this paper, we introduce FATE, a deep few-shot learning-based framework that leverages limited anomaly examples and learns anomaly scores explicitly in an end-to-end method using deviation learning. In this approach, the anomaly scores of normal examples are adjusted to closely resemble reference scores obtained from a prior distribution. Conversely, anomaly samples are forced to have anomalous scores that considerably deviate from the reference score in the upper tail of the prior. Additionally, our model is optimized to learn the distinct behavior of anomalies by utilizing a multi-head self-attention layer and multiple instance learning approaches. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach attains a new level of state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization is a critical ability for deep learning models in many real-world scenarios including healthcare and autonomous vehicles. Recently, different techniques have been proposed to improve OOD generalization. Among these methods, gradient-based regularizers have shown promising performance compared with other competitors. Despite this success, our understanding of the role of Hessian and gradient alignment in domain generalization is still limited. To address this shortcoming, we analyze the role of the classifier’s head Hessian matrix and gradient in domain generalization using recent OOD theory of transferability. Theoretically, we show that spectral norm between the classifier’s head Hessian matrices across domains is an upper bound of the transfer measure, a notion of distance between target and source domains. Furthermore, we analyze all the attributes that get aligned when we encourage similarity between Hessians and gradients. Our analysis explains the success of many regularizers like CORAL, IRM, V-REx, Fish, IGA, and Fishr as they regularize part of the classifier’s head Hessian and&#x2F;or gradient. Finally, we propose two simple yet effective methods to match the classifier’s head Hessians and gradients in an efficient way, based on the Hessian Gradient Product (HGP) and Hutchinson’s method (Hutchinson), and without directly calculating Hessians. We validate the OOD generalization ability of proposed methods in different scenarios, including transferability, severe correlation shift, label shift and diversity shift. Our results show that Hessian alignment methods achieve promising performance on various OOD benchmarks.

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper presents a sparse Change-Based Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (CB-ConvLSTM) model for event-based eye tracking, key for next-generation wearable healthcare technology such as AR&#x2F;VR headsets. We leverage the benefits of retina-inspired event cameras, namely their low-latency response and sparse output event stream, over traditional frame-based cameras. Our CB-ConvLSTM architecture efficiently extracts spatio-temporal features for pupil tracking from the event stream, outperforming conventional CNN structures. Utilizing a delta-encoded recurrent path enhancing activation sparsity, CB-ConvLSTM reduces arithmetic operations by approximately 4.7$\times$ without losing accuracy when tested on a \texttt{v2e}-generated event dataset of labeled pupils. This increase in efficiency makes it ideal for real-time eye tracking in resource-constrained devices.

<p>Abstract:<br>We introduce a novel profile-based patient clustering model designed for clinical data in healthcare. By utilizing a method grounded on constrained low-rank approximation, our model takes advantage of patients’ clinical data and digital interaction data, including browsing and search, to construct patient profiles. As a result of the method, nonnegative embedding vectors are generated, serving as a low-dimensional representation of the patients. Our model was assessed using real-world patient data from a healthcare web portal, with a comprehensive evaluation approach which considered clustering and recommendation capabilities. In comparison to other baselines, our approach demonstrated superior performance in terms of clustering coherence and recommendation accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Accurately estimating the 3D pose and shape is an essential step towards understanding animal behavior, and can potentially benefit many downstream applications, such as wildlife conservation. However, research in this area is held back by the lack of a comprehensive and diverse dataset with high-quality 3D pose and shape annotations. In this paper, we propose Animal3D, the first comprehensive dataset for mammal animal 3D pose and shape estimation. Animal3D consists of 3379 images collected from 40 mammal species, high-quality annotations of 26 keypoints, and importantly the pose and shape parameters of the SMAL model. All annotations were labeled and checked manually in a multi-stage process to ensure highest quality results. Based on the Animal3D dataset, we benchmark representative shape and pose estimation models at: (1) supervised learning from only the Animal3D data, (2) synthetic to real transfer from synthetically generated images, and (3) fine-tuning human pose and shape estimation models. Our experimental results demonstrate that predicting the 3D shape and pose of animals across species remains a very challenging task, despite significant advances in human pose estimation. Our results further demonstrate that synthetic pre-training is a viable strategy to boost the model performance. Overall, Animal3D opens new directions for facilitating future research in animal 3D pose and shape estimation, and is publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The ‘pre-train, prompt, predict’ paradigm of large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable success in open-domain question answering (OD-QA). However, few works explore this paradigm in the scenario of multi-document question answering (MD-QA), a task demanding a thorough understanding of the logical associations among the contents and structures of different documents. To fill this crucial gap, we propose a Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP) method to formulate the right context in prompting LLMs for MD-QA, which consists of a graph construction module and a graph traversal module. For graph construction, we create a knowledge graph (KG) over multiple documents with nodes symbolizing passages or document structures (e.g., pages&#x2F;tables), and edges denoting the semantic&#x2F;lexical similarity between passages or intra-document structural relations. For graph traversal, we design an LM-guided graph traverser that navigates across nodes and gathers supporting passages assisting LLMs in MD-QA. The constructed graph serves as the global ruler that regulates the transitional space among passages and reduces retrieval latency. Concurrently, the LM-guided traverser acts as a local navigator that gathers pertinent context to progressively approach the question and guarantee retrieval quality. Extensive experiments underscore the efficacy of KGP for MD-QA, signifying the potential of leveraging graphs in enhancing the prompt design for LLMs. Our code is at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/YuWVandy/KG-LLM-MDQA">https://github.com/YuWVandy/KG-LLM-MDQA</a>.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Historically, much of machine learning research has focused on the performance of the algorithm alone, but recently more attention has been focused on optimizing joint human-algorithm performance. Here, we analyze a specific type of human-algorithm collaboration where the algorithm has access to a set of $n$ items, and presents a subset of size $k$ to the human, who selects a final item from among those $k$. This scenario could model content recommendation, route planning, or any type of labeling task. Because both the human and algorithm have imperfect, noisy information about the true ordering of items, the key question is: which value of $k$ maximizes the probability that the best item will be ultimately selected? For $k&#x3D;1$, performance is optimized by the algorithm acting alone, and for $k&#x3D;n$ it is optimized by the human acting alone. Surprisingly, we show that for multiple of noise models, it is optimal to set $k \in [2, n-1]$ - that is, there are strict benefits to collaborating, even when the human and algorithm have equal accuracy separately. We demonstrate this theoretically for the Mallows model and experimentally for the Random Utilities models of noisy permutations. However, we show this pattern is reversed when the human is anchored on the algorithm’s presented ordering - the joint system always has strictly worse performance. We extend these results to the case where the human and algorithm differ in their accuracy levels, showing that there always exist regimes where a more accurate agent would strictly benefit from collaborating with a less accurate one, but these regimes are asymmetric between the human and the algorithm’s accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The rapid entry of machine learning approaches in our daily activities and high-stakes domains demands transparency and scrutiny of their fairness and reliability. To help gauge machine learning models’ robustness, research typically focuses on the massive datasets used for their deployment, e.g., creating and maintaining documentation for understanding their origin, process of development, and ethical considerations. However, data collection for AI is still typically a one-off practice, and oftentimes datasets collected for a certain purpose or application are reused for a different problem. Additionally, dataset annotations may not be representative over time, contain ambiguous or erroneous annotations, or be unable to generalize across issues or domains. Recent research has shown these practices might lead to unfair, biased, or inaccurate outcomes. We argue that data collection for AI should be performed in a responsible manner where the quality of the data is thoroughly scrutinized and measured through a systematic set of appropriate metrics. In this paper, we propose a Responsible AI (RAI) methodology designed to guide the data collection with a set of metrics for an iterative in-depth analysis of the factors influencing the quality and reliability} of the generated data. We propose a granular set of measurements to inform on the internal reliability of a dataset and its external stability over time. We validate our approach across nine existing datasets and annotation tasks and four content modalities. This approach impacts the assessment of data robustness used for AI applied in the real world, where diversity of users and content is eminent. Furthermore, it deals with fairness and accountability aspects in data collection by providing systematic and transparent quality analysis for data collections.</p>

However, many of best performing models have training and generation times that do not scale well to high-dimensional calorimeter showers. In this work, we introduce SuperCalo, a flow-based super-resolution model, and demonstrate that high-dimensional fine-grained calorimeter showers can be quickly upsampled from coarse-grained showers. This novel approach presents a way to reduce computational cost, memory requirements and generation time associated with fast calorimeter simulation models. Additionally, we show that the showers upsampled by SuperCalo possess a high degree of variation. This allows a large number of high-dimensional calorimeter showers to be upsampled from much fewer coarse showers with high-fidelity, which results in additional reduction in generation time.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The increasing versatility of language models LMs has given rise to a new class of benchmarks that comprehensively assess a broad range of capabilities. Such benchmarks are associated with massive computational costs reaching thousands of GPU hours per model. However the efficiency aspect of these evaluation efforts had raised little discussion in the literature. In this work we present the problem of Efficient Benchmarking namely intelligently reducing the computation costs of LM evaluation without compromising reliability. Using the HELM benchmark as a test case we investigate how different benchmark design choices affect the computation-reliability tradeoff. We propose to evaluate the reliability of such decisions by using a new measure Decision Impact on Reliability DIoR for short. We find for example that the current leader on HELM may change by merely removing a low-ranked model from the benchmark and observe that a handful of examples suffice to obtain the correct benchmark ranking. Conversely a slightly different choice of HELM scenarios varies ranking widely. Based on our findings we outline a set of concrete recommendations for more efficient benchmark design and utilization practices leading to dramatic cost savings with minimal loss of benchmark reliability often reducing computation by x100 or more.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Deep learning based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has demonstrated significant advancements in data reconstruction compared to separate source-channel coding (SSCC). This superiority arises from the suboptimality of SSCC when dealing with finite block-length data. Moreover, SSCC falls short in reconstructing data in a multi-user and&#x2F;or multi-resolution fashion, as it only tries to satisfy the worst channel and&#x2F;or the highest quality data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning multi-resolution JSCC framework inspired by the concept of multi-task learning (MTL). This proposed framework excels at encoding data for different resolutions through hierarchical layers and effectively decodes it by leveraging both current and past layers of encoded data. Moreover, this framework holds great potential for semantic communication, where the objective extends beyond data reconstruction to preserving specific semantic attributes throughout the communication process. These semantic features could be crucial elements such as class labels, essential for classification tasks, or other key attributes that require preservation. Within this framework, each level of encoded data can be carefully designed to retain specific data semantics. As a result, the precision of a semantic classifier can be progressively enhanced across successive layers, emphasizing the preservation of targeted semantics throughout the encoding and decoding stages. We conduct experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10 dataset. The experiment with both datasets illustrates that our proposed method is capable of surpassing the SSCC method in reconstructing data with different resolutions, enabling the extraction of semantic features with heightened confidence in successive layers. This capability is particularly advantageous for prioritizing and preserving more crucial semantic features within the datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The introduction of the transformer architecture and the self-attention mechanism has led to an explosive production of language models trained on specific downstream tasks and data domains. With over 200, 000 models in the Hugging Face ecosystem, users grapple with selecting and optimizing models to suit multifaceted workflows and data domains while addressing computational, security, and recency concerns. There is an urgent need for machine learning frameworks that can eliminate the burden of model selection and customization and unleash the incredible power of the vast emerging model library for end users. Here, we propose a context-aware routing system, Tryage, that leverages a language model router for optimal selection of expert models from a model library based on analysis of individual input prompts. Inspired by the thalamic router in the brain, Tryage employs a perceptive router to predict down-stream model performance on prompts and, then, makes a routing decision using an objective function that integrates performance predictions with user goals and constraints that are incorporated through flags (e.g., model size, model recency). Tryage allows users to explore a Pareto front and automatically trade-off between task accuracy and secondary goals including minimization of model size, recency, security, verbosity, and readability. Across heterogeneous data sets that include code, text, clinical data, and patents, the Tryage framework surpasses Gorilla and GPT3.5 turbo in dynamic model selection identifying the optimal model with an accuracy of 50.9% , compared to 23.6% by GPT 3.5 Turbo and 10.8% by Gorilla. Conceptually, Tryage demonstrates how routing models can be applied to program and control the behavior of multi-model LLM systems to maximize efficient use of the expanding and evolving language model ecosystem.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Learning relies on coordinated synaptic changes in recurrently connected populations of neurons. Therefore, understanding the collective evolution of synaptic connectivity over learning is a key challenge in neuroscience and machine learning. In particular, recent work has shown that the weight matrices of task-trained RNNs are typically low rank, but how this low rank structure unfolds over learning is unknown. To address this, we investigate the rank of the 3-tensor formed by the weight matrices throughout learning. By fitting RNNs of varying rank to large-scale neural recordings during a motor learning task, we find that the inferred weights are low-tensor-rank and therefore evolve over a fixed low-dimensional subspace throughout the entire course of learning. We next validate the observation of low-tensor-rank learning on an RNN trained to solve the same task by performing a low-tensor-rank decomposition directly on the ground truth weights, and by showing that the method we applied to the data faithfully recovers this low rank structure. Finally, we present a set of mathematical results bounding the matrix and tensor ranks of gradient descent learning dynamics which show that low-tensor-rank weights emerge naturally in RNNs trained to solve low-dimensional tasks. Taken together, our findings provide novel constraints on the evolution of population connectivity over learning in both biological and artificial neural networks, and enable reverse engineering of learning-induced changes in recurrent network dynamics from large-scale neural recordings.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Edge Machine Learning (Edge ML), which shifts computational intelligence from cloud-based systems to edge devices, is attracting significant interest due to its evident benefits including reduced latency, enhanced data privacy, and decreased connectivity reliance. While these advantages are compelling, they introduce unique challenges absent in traditional cloud-based approaches. In this paper, we delve into the intricacies of Edge-based learning, examining the interdependencies among: (i) constrained data storage on Edge devices, (ii) limited computational power for training, and (iii) the number of learning classes. Through experiments conducted using our MAGNETO system, that focused on learning human activities via data collected from mobile sensors, we highlight these challenges and offer valuable perspectives on Edge ML.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Video-Text Retrieval (VTR) is a crucial multi-modal task in an era of massive video-text data on the Internet. A plethora of work characterized by using a two-stream Vision-Language model architecture that learns a joint representation of video-text pairs has become a prominent approach for the VTR task. However, these models operate under the assumption of bijective video-text correspondences and neglect a more practical scenario where video content usually encompasses multiple events, while texts like user queries or webpage metadata tend to be specific and correspond to single events. This establishes a gap between the previous training objective and real-world applications, leading to the potential performance degradation of earlier models during inference. In this study, we introduce the Multi-event Video-Text Retrieval (MeVTR) task, addressing scenarios in which each video contains multiple different events, as a niche scenario of the conventional Video-Text Retrieval Task. We present a simple model, Me-Retriever, which incorporates key event video representation and a new MeVTR loss for the MeVTR task. Comprehensive experiments show that this straightforward framework outperforms other models in the Video-to-Text and Text-to-Video tasks, effectively establishing a robust baseline for the MeVTR task. We believe this work serves as a strong foundation for future studies.
