<p>Abstract:<br>Recently, the ability of language models (LMs) has attracted increasing attention in visual cross-modality. In this paper, we further explore the generation capacity of LMs for sound event detection (SED), beyond the visual domain. Specifically, we propose an elegant method that aligns audio features and text features to accomplish sound event classification and temporal location. The framework consists of an acoustic encoder, a contrastive module that align the corresponding representations of the text and audio, and a decoupled language decoder that generates temporal and event sequences from the audio characteristic. Compared with conventional works that require complicated processing and barely utilize limited audio features, our model is more concise and comprehensive since language model directly leverage its semantic capabilities to generate the sequences. We investigate different decoupling modules to demonstrate the effectiveness for timestamps capture and event classification. Evaluation results show that the proposed method achieves accurate sequences of sound event detection.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The hearing loss of almost half a billion people is commonly treated with hearing aids. However, current hearing aids often do not work well in real-world noisy environments. We present a deep learning based denoising system that runs in real time on iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S10 (25ms algorithmic latency). The denoised audio is streamed to the hearing aid, resulting in a total delay of around 75ms. In tests with hearing aid users having moderate to severe hearing loss, our denoising system improves audio across three tests: 1) listening for subjective audio ratings, 2) listening for objective speech intelligibility, and 3) live conversations in a noisy environment for subjective ratings. Subjective ratings increase by more than 40%, for both the listening test and the live conversation compared to a fitted hearing aid as a baseline. Speech reception thresholds, measuring speech understanding in noise, improve by 1.6 dB SRT. Ours is the first denoising system that is implemented on a mobile device, streamed directly to users’ hearing aids using only a single channel as audio input while improving user satisfaction on all tested aspects, including speech intelligibility. This includes overall preference of the denoised and streamed signal over the hearing aid, thereby accepting the higher latency for the significant improvement in speech understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper presents an end-to-end model designed to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) for a particular speaker in a crowded, noisy environment. The model utilizes a single-channel speech enhancement module that isolates the speaker’s voice from background noise, along with an ASR module. Through this approach, the model is able to decrease the word error rate (WER) of ASR from 80% to 26.4%. Typically, these two components are adjusted independently due to variations in data requirements. However, speech enhancement can create anomalies that decrease ASR efficiency. By implementing a joint fine-tuning strategy, the model can reduce the WER from 26.4% in separate tuning to 14.5% in joint tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Speaker anonymization systems continue to improve their ability to obfuscate the original speaker characteristics in a speech signal, but often create processing artifacts and unnatural sounding voices as a tradeoff. Many of those systems stem from the VoicePrivacy Challenge (VPC) Baseline B1, using a neural vocoder to synthesize speech from an F0, x-vectors and bottleneck features-based speech representation. Inspired by this, we investigate the reproduction capabilities of the aforementioned baseline, to assess how successful the shared methodology is in synthesizing human-like speech. We use four objective metrics to measure speech quality, waveform similarity, and F0 similarity. Our findings indicate that both the speech representation and the vocoder introduces artifacts, causing an unnatural perception. A MUSHRA-like listening test on 18 subjects corroborate our findings, motivating further research on the analysis and synthesis components of the VPC Baseline B1.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Text-to-music generation (T2M-Gen) faces a major obstacle due to the scarcity of large-scale publicly available music datasets with natural language captions. To address this, we propose the Music Understanding LLaMA (MU-LLaMA), capable of answering music-related questions and generating captions for music files. Our model utilizes audio representations from a pretrained MERT model to extract music features. However, obtaining a suitable dataset for training the MU-LLaMA model remains challenging, as existing publicly accessible audio question answering datasets lack the necessary depth for open-ended music question answering. To fill this gap, we present a methodology for generating question-answer pairs from existing audio captioning datasets and introduce the MusicQA Dataset designed for answering open-ended music-related questions. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed MU-LLaMA model, trained on our designed MusicQA dataset, achieves outstanding performance in both music question answering and music caption generation across various metrics, outperforming current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in both fields and offering a promising advancement in the T2M-Gen research field.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Tablature notation is widely used in popular music to transcribe and share guitar musical content. As a complement to standard score notation, tablatures transcribe performance gesture information including finger positions and a variety of guitar-specific playing techniques such as slides, hammer-on&#x2F;pull-off or bends.This paper focuses on bends, which enable to progressively shift the pitch of a note, therefore circumventing physical limitations of the discrete fretted fingerboard. In this paper, we propose a set of 25 high-level features, computed for each note of the tablature, to study how bend occurrences can be predicted from their past and future short-term context. Experiments are performed on a corpus of 932 lead guitar tablatures of popular music and show that a decision tree successfully predicts bend occurrences with an F1 score of 0.71 anda limited amount of false positive predictions, demonstrating promising applications to assist the arrangement of non-guitar music into guitar tablatures.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Wav2vec2 has achieved success in applying Transformer architecture and self-supervised learning to speech recognition. Recently, these have come to be used not only for speech recognition but also for the entire speech processing. This paper introduces an effective end-to-end speaker identification model applied Transformer-based contextual model. We explored the relationship between the parameters and the performance in order to discern the structure of an effective model. Furthermore, we propose a pooling method, Temporal Gate Pooling, with powerful learning ability for speaker identification. We applied Conformer as encoder and BEST-RQ for pre-training and conducted an evaluation utilizing the speaker identification of VoxCeleb1. The proposed method has achieved an accuracy of 85.9% with 28.5M parameters, demonstrating comparable precision to wav2vec2 with 317.7M parameters.

<p>Abstract:<br>Voice conversion as the style transfer task applied to speech, refers to converting one person’s speech into a new speech that sounds like another person’s. Up to now, there has been a lot of research devoted to better implementation of VC tasks. However, a good voice conversion model should not only match the timbre information of the target speaker, but also expressive information such as prosody, pace, pause, etc. In this context, prosody modeling is crucial for achieving expressive voice conversion that sounds natural and convincing. Unfortunately, prosody modeling is important but challenging, especially without text transcriptions. In this paper, we firstly propose a novel voice conversion framework named ‘PMVC’, which effectively separates and models the content, timbre, and prosodic information from the speech without text transcriptions. Specially, we introduce a new speech augmentation algorithm for robust prosody extraction. And building upon this, mask and predict mechanism is applied in the disentanglement of prosody and content information. The experimental results on the AIShell-3 corpus supports our improvement of naturalness and similarity of converted speech.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Echo cancellation and noise reduction are essential for full-duplex communication, yet most existing neural networks have high computational costs and are inflexible in tuning model complexity. In this paper, we introduce time-frequency dual-path compression to achieve a wide range of compression ratios on computational cost. Specifically, for frequency compression, trainable filters are used to replace manually designed filters for dimension reduction. For time compression, only using frame skipped prediction causes large performance degradation, which can be alleviated by a post-processing network with full sequence modeling. We have found that under fixed compression ratios, dual-path compression combining both the time and frequency methods will give further performance improvement, covering compression ratios from 4x to 32x with little model size change. Moreover, the proposed models show competitive performance compared with fast FullSubNet and DeepFilterNet.
