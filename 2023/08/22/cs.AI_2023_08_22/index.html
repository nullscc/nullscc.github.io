<p>Abstract:<br>Recently, the ability of language models (LMs) has attracted increasing attention in visual cross-modality. In this paper, we further explore the generation capacity of LMs for sound event detection (SED), beyond the visual domain. Specifically, we propose an elegant method that aligns audio features and text features to accomplish sound event classification and temporal location. The framework consists of an acoustic encoder, a contrastive module that align the corresponding representations of the text and audio, and a decoupled language decoder that generates temporal and event sequences from the audio characteristic. Compared with conventional works that require complicated processing and barely utilize limited audio features, our model is more concise and comprehensive since language model directly leverage its semantic capabilities to generate the sequences. We investigate different decoupling modules to demonstrate the effectiveness for timestamps capture and event classification. Evaluation results show that the proposed method achieves accurate sequences of sound event detection.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The field of multi-object tracking has recently seen a renewed interest in the good old schema of tracking-by-detection, as its simplicity and strong priors spare it from the complex design and painful babysitting of tracking-by-attention approaches. In view of this, we aim at extending tracking-by-detection to multi-modal settings, where a comprehensive cost has to be computed from heterogeneous information e.g., 2D motion cues, visual appearance, and pose estimates. More precisely, we follow a case study where a rough estimate of 3D information is also available and must be merged with other traditional metrics (e.g., the IoU). To achieve that, recent approaches resort to either simple rules or complex heuristics to balance the contribution of each cost. However, i) they require careful tuning of tailored hyperparameters on a hold-out set, and ii) they imply these costs to be independent, which does not hold in reality. We address these issues by building upon an elegant probabilistic formulation, which considers the cost of a candidate association as the negative log-likelihood yielded by a deep density estimator, trained to model the conditional joint probability distribution of correct associations. Our experiments, conducted on both simulated and real benchmarks, show that our approach consistently enhances the performance of several tracking-by-detection algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Social media users often hold several accounts in their effort to multiply the spread of their thoughts, ideas, and viewpoints. In the particular case of objectionable content, users tend to create multiple accounts to bypass the combating measures enforced by social media platforms and thus retain their online identity even if some of their accounts are suspended. User identity linkage aims to reveal social media accounts likely to belong to the same natural person so as to prevent the spread of abusive&#x2F;illegal activities. To this end, this work proposes a machine learning-based detection model, which uses multiple attributes of users’ online activity in order to identify whether two or more virtual identities belong to the same real natural person. The models efficacy is demonstrated on two cases on abusive and terrorism-related Twitter content.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various NLP tasks. However, previous works have shown these models are sensitive towards prompt wording, and few-shot demonstrations and their order, posing challenges to fair assessment of these models. As these models become more powerful, it becomes imperative to understand and address these limitations. In this paper, we focus on LLMs robustness on the task of multiple-choice questions – commonly adopted task to study reasoning and fact-retrieving capability of LLMs. Investigating the sensitivity of LLMs towards the order of options in multiple-choice questions, we demonstrate a considerable performance gap of approximately 13% to 75% in LLMs on different benchmarks, when answer options are reordered, even when using demonstrations in a few-shot setting. Through a detailed analysis, we conjecture that this sensitivity arises when LLMs are uncertain about the prediction between the top-2&#x2F;3 choices, and specific options placements may favor certain prediction between those top choices depending on the question caused by positional bias. We also identify patterns in top-2 choices that amplify or mitigate the model’s bias toward option placement. We found that for amplifying bias, the optimal strategy involves positioning the top two choices as the first and last options. Conversely, to mitigate bias, we recommend placing these choices among the adjacent options. To validate our conjecture, we conduct various experiments and adopt two approaches to calibrate LLMs’ predictions, leading to up to 8 percentage points improvement across different models and benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Improving the reliability of deployed machine learning systems often involves developing methods to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. However, existing research often narrowly focuses on samples from classes that are absent from the training set, neglecting other types of plausible distribution shifts. This limitation reduces the applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios, where systems encounter a wide variety of anomalous inputs. In this study, we categorize five distinct types of distribution shifts and critically evaluate the performance of recent OOD detection methods on each of them. We publicly release our benchmark under the name BROAD (Benchmarking Resilience Over Anomaly Diversity). Our findings reveal that while these methods excel in detecting unknown classes, their performance is inconsistent when encountering other types of distribution shifts. In other words, they only reliably detect unexpected inputs that they have been specifically designed to expect. As a first step toward broad OOD detection, we learn a generative model of existing detection scores with a Gaussian mixture. By doing so, we present an ensemble approach that offers a more consistent and comprehensive solution for broad OOD detection, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. Our code to download BROAD and reproduce our experiments is publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Decision trees are highly interpretable models for solving classification problems in machine learning (ML). The standard ML algorithms for training decision trees are fast but generate suboptimal trees in terms of accuracy. Other discrete optimization models in the literature address the optimality problem but only work well on relatively small datasets. \cite{firat2020column} proposed a column-generation-based heuristic approach for learning decision trees. This approach improves scalability and can work with large datasets. In this paper, we describe improvements to this column generation approach. First, we modify the subproblem model to significantly reduce the number of subproblems in multiclass classification instances. Next, we show that the data-dependent constraints in the master problem are implied, and use them as cutting planes. Furthermore, we describe a separation model to generate data points for which the linear programming relaxation solution violates their corresponding constraints. We conclude by presenting computational results that show that these modifications result in better scalability.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recent strides in Text-to-3D techniques have been propelled by distilling knowledge from powerful large text-to-image diffusion models (LDMs). Nonetheless, existing Text-to-3D approaches often grapple with challenges such as over-saturation, inadequate detailing, and unrealistic outputs. This study presents a novel strategy that leverages explicitly synthesized multi-view images to address these issues. Our approach involves the utilization of image-to-image pipelines, empowered by LDMs, to generate posed high-quality images based on the renderings of coarse 3D models. Although the generated images mostly alleviate the aforementioned issues, challenges such as view inconsistency and significant content variance persist due to the inherent generative nature of large diffusion models, posing extensive difficulties in leveraging these images effectively. To overcome this hurdle, we advocate integrating a discriminator alongside a novel Diffusion-GAN dual training strategy to guide the training of 3D models. For the incorporated discriminator, the synthesized multi-view images are considered real data, while the renderings of the optimized 3D models function as fake data. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over baseline approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This work targets what we consider to be the foundational step for urban airborne robots, a safe landing. Our attention is directed toward what we deem the most crucial aspect of the safe landing perception stack: segmentation. We present a streamlined reactive UAV system that employs visual servoing by harnessing the capabilities of open vocabulary image segmentation. This approach can adapt to various scenarios with minimal adjustments, bypassing the necessity for extensive data accumulation for refining internal models, thanks to its open vocabulary methodology. Given the limitations imposed by local authorities, our primary focus centers on operations originating from altitudes of 100 meters. This choice is deliberate, as numerous preceding works have dealt with altitudes up to 30 meters, aligning with the capabilities of small stereo cameras. Consequently, we leave the remaining 20m to be navigated using conventional 3D path planning methods. Utilizing monocular cameras and image segmentation, our findings demonstrate the system’s capability to successfully execute landing maneuvers at altitudes as low as 20 meters. However, this approach is vulnerable to intermittent and occasionally abrupt fluctuations in the segmentation between frames in a video stream. To address this challenge, we enhance the image segmentation output by introducing what we call a dynamic focus: a masking mechanism that self adjusts according to the current landing stage. This dynamic focus guides the control system to avoid regions beyond the drone’s safety radius projected onto the ground, thus mitigating the problems with fluctuations. Through the implementation of this supplementary layer, our experiments have reached improvements in the landing success rate of almost tenfold when compared to global segmentation. All the source code is open source and available online (github.com&#x2F;MISTLab&#x2F;DOVESEI).</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Federated learning (FL) inevitably confronts the challenge of system heterogeneity in practical scenarios. To enhance the capabilities of most model-homogeneous FL methods in handling system heterogeneity, we propose a training scheme that can extend their capabilities to cope with this challenge. In this paper, we commence our study with a detailed exploration of homogeneous and heterogeneous FL settings and discover three key observations: (1) a positive correlation between client performance and layer similarities, (2) higher similarities in the shallow layers in contrast to the deep layers, and (3) the smoother gradients distributions indicate the higher layer similarities. Building upon these observations, we propose InCo Aggregation that leverags internal cross-layer gradients, a mixture of gradients from shallow and deep layers within a server model, to augment the similarity in the deep layers without requiring additional communication between clients. Furthermore, our methods can be tailored to accommodate model-homogeneous FL methods such as FedAvg, FedProx, FedNova, Scaffold, and MOON, to expand their capabilities to handle the system heterogeneity. Copious experimental results validate the effectiveness of InCo Aggregation, spotlighting internal cross-layer gradients as a promising avenue to enhance the performance in heterogenous FL.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Learning meaningful representations is at the heart of many tasks in the field of modern machine learning. Recently, a lot of methods were introduced that allow learning of image representations without supervision. These representations can then be used in downstream tasks like classification or object detection. The quality of these representations is close to supervised learning, while no labeled images are needed. This survey paper provides a comprehensive review of these methods in a unified notation, points out similarities and differences of these methods, and proposes a taxonomy which sets these methods in relation to each other. Furthermore, our survey summarizes the most-recent experimental results reported in the literature in form of a meta-study. Our survey is intended as a starting point for researchers and practitioners who want to dive into the field of representation learning.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We provide the first convergence guarantees for the Consistency Models (CMs), a newly emerging type of one-step generative models that can generate comparable samples to those generated by Diffusion Models. Our main result is that, under the basic assumptions on score-matching errors, consistency errors and smoothness of the data distribution, CMs can efficiently sample from any realistic data distribution in one step with small $W_2$ error. Our results (1) hold for $L^2$-accurate score and consistency assumption (rather than $L^\infty$-accurate); (2) do note require strong assumptions on the data distribution such as log-Sobelev inequality; (3) scale polynomially in all parameters; and (4) match the state-of-the-art convergence guarantee for score-based generative models (SGMs). We also provide the result that the Multistep Consistency Sampling procedure can further reduce the error comparing to one step sampling, which support the original statement of “Consistency Models, Yang Song 2023”. Our result further imply a TV error guarantee when take some Langevin-based modifications to the output distributions.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Aspect-based sentiment classification is a crucial problem in fine-grained sentiment analysis, which aims to predict the sentiment polarity of the given aspect according to its context. Previous works have made remarkable progress in leveraging attention mechanism to extract opinion words for different aspects. However, a persistent challenge is the effective management of semantic mismatches, which stem from attention mechanisms that fall short in adequately aligning opinions words with their corresponding aspect in multi-aspect sentences. To address this issue, we propose a novel Aspect-oriented Opinion Alignment Network (AOAN) to capture the contextual association between opinion words and the corresponding aspect. Specifically, we first introduce a neighboring span enhanced module which highlights various compositions of neighboring words and given aspects. In addition, we design a multi-perspective attention mechanism that align relevant opinion information with respect to the given aspect. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results.

<p>Abstract:<br>The machine learning modeling process conventionally culminates in selecting a single model that maximizes a selected performance metric. However, this approach leads to abandoning a more profound analysis of slightly inferior models. Particularly in medical and healthcare studies, where the objective extends beyond predictions to valuable insight generation, relying solely on performance metrics can result in misleading or incomplete conclusions. This problem is particularly pertinent when dealing with a set of models with performance close to maximum one, known as $\textit{Rashomon set}$. Such a set can be numerous and may contain models describing the data in a different way, which calls for comprehensive analysis. This paper introduces a novel process to explore Rashomon set models, extending the conventional modeling approach. The cornerstone is the identification of the most different models within the Rashomon set, facilitated by the introduced $\texttt{Rashomon_DETECT}$ algorithm. This algorithm compares profiles illustrating prediction dependencies on variable values generated by eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques. To quantify differences in variable effects among models, we introduce the Profile Disparity Index (PDI) based on measures from functional data analysis. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we showcase its application in predicting survival among hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) patients - a foundational case study. Additionally, we benchmark our approach on other medical data sets, demonstrating its versatility and utility in various contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>A person’s gender is a crucial piece of information when performing research across a wide range of scientific disciplines, such as medicine, sociology, political science, and economics, to name a few. However, in increasing instances, especially given the proliferation of big data, gender information is not readily available. In such cases researchers need to infer gender from readily available information, primarily from persons’ names. While inferring gender from name may raise some ethical questions, the lack of viable alternatives means that researchers have to resort to such approaches when the goal justifies the means - in the majority of such studies the goal is to examine patterns and determinants of gender disparities. The necessity of name-to-gender inference has generated an ever-growing domain of algorithmic approaches and software products. These approaches have been used throughout the world in academia, industry, governmental and non-governmental organizations. Nevertheless, the existing approaches have yet to be systematically evaluated and compared, making it challenging to determine the optimal approach for future research. In this work, we conducted a large scale performance evaluation of existing approaches for name-to-gender inference. Analysis are performed using a variety of large annotated datasets of names. We further propose two new hybrid approaches that achieve better performance than any single existing approach.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Autonomous agents have long been a prominent research topic in the academic community. Previous research in this field often focuses on training agents with limited knowledge within isolated environments, which diverges significantly from the human learning processes, and thus makes the agents hard to achieve human-like decisions. Recently, through the acquisition of vast amounts of web knowledge, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in achieving human-level intelligence. This has sparked an upsurge in studies investigating autonomous agents based on LLMs. To harness the full potential of LLMs, researchers have devised diverse agent architectures tailored to different applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these studies, delivering a systematic review of the field of autonomous agents from a holistic perspective. More specifically, our focus lies in the construction of LLM-based agents, for which we propose a unified framework that encompasses a majority of the previous work. Additionally, we provide a summary of the various applications of LLM-based AI agents in the domains of social science, natural science, and engineering. Lastly, we discuss the commonly employed evaluation strategies for LLM-based AI agents. Based on the previous studies, we also present several challenges and future directions in this field.

<p>Abstract:<br>The Potential Outcome Framework (POF) plays a prominent role in the field of causal inference. Most causal inference models based on the POF (CIMs-B-POF) are designed for eliminating confounding bias and default to an underlying assumption of Confounding Covariates. This assumption posits that the covariates consist solely of confounders. However, the assumption of Confounding Covariates is challenging to maintain in practice, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional covariates. While certain methods have been proposed to differentiate the distinct components of covariates prior to conducting causal inference, the consequences of treating non-confounding covariates as confounders remain unclear. This ambiguity poses a potential risk when applying the CIMs-B-POF in practical scenarios. In this paper, we present a unified graphical framework for the CIMs-B-POF, which greatly enhances the comprehension of these models’ underlying principles. Using this graphical framework, we quantitatively analyze the extent to which the inference performance of CIMs-B-POF is influenced when incorporating various types of non-confounding covariates, such as instrumental variables, mediators, colliders, and adjustment variables. The key findings are: in the task of eliminating confounding bias, the optimal scenario is for the covariates to exclusively encompass confounders; in the subsequent task of inferring counterfactual outcomes, the adjustment variables contribute to more accurate inferences. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted on synthetic datasets consistently validate these theoretical conclusions.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The future of the arts and artificial intelligence (AI) is promising as technology advances. As the use of AI in design becomes more widespread, art practice may not be a human-only art form and could instead become a digitally integrated experience. With enhanced creativity and collaboration, arts and AI could work together towards creating artistic outputs that are visually appealing and meet the needs of the artist and viewer. While it is uncertain how far the integration will go, arts and AI will likely influence one another. This workshop pictorial puts forward first-person research that shares interactions between an HCI researcher and AI as they try to escape the creative block. The pictorial paper explores two questions: How can AI support artists’ creativity, and what does it mean to be explainable in this context? HIs, ChatGPT and Midjourney were engaged; the result was a series of reflections that require further discussion and explorations in the XAIxArts community: Transparency of attribution, the creation process, ethics of asking, and inspiration vs copying.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Vision transformers have shown unprecedented levels of performance in tackling various visual perception tasks in recent years. However, the architectural and computational complexity of such network architectures have made them challenging to deploy in real-world applications with high-throughput, low-memory requirements. As such, there has been significant research recently on the design of efficient vision transformer architectures. In this study, we explore the generation of fast vision transformer architecture designs via generative architecture search (GAS) to achieve a strong balance between accuracy and architectural and computational efficiency. Through this generative architecture search process, we create TurboViT, a highly efficient hierarchical vision transformer architecture design that is generated around mask unit attention and Q-pooling design patterns. The resulting TurboViT architecture design achieves significantly lower architectural computational complexity (&gt;2.47$\times$ smaller than FasterViT-0 while achieving same accuracy) and computational complexity (&gt;3.4$\times$ fewer FLOPs and 0.9% higher accuracy than MobileViT2-2.0) when compared to 10 other state-of-the-art efficient vision transformer network architecture designs within a similar range of accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset. Furthermore, TurboViT demonstrated strong inference latency and throughput in both low-latency and batch processing scenarios (&gt;3.21$\times$ lower latency and &gt;3.18$\times$ higher throughput compared to FasterViT-0 for low-latency scenario). These promising results demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging generative architecture search for generating efficient transformer architecture designs for high-throughput scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Regression analysis is a key area of interest in the field of data analysis and machine learning which is devoted to exploring the dependencies between variables, often using vectors. The emergence of high dimensional data in technologies such as neuroimaging, computer vision, climatology and social networks, has brought challenges to traditional data representation methods. Tensors, as high dimensional extensions of vectors, are considered as natural representations of high dimensional data. In this book, the authors provide a systematic study and analysis of tensor-based regression models and their applications in recent years. It groups and illustrates the existing tensor-based regression methods and covers the basics, core ideas, and theoretical characteristics of most tensor-based regression methods. In addition, readers can learn how to use existing tensor-based regression methods to solve specific regression tasks with multiway data, what datasets can be selected, and what software packages are available to start related work as soon as possible. Tensor Regression is the first thorough overview of the fundamentals, motivations, popular algorithms, strategies for efficient implementation, related applications, available datasets, and software resources for tensor-based regression analysis. It is essential reading for all students, researchers and practitioners of working on high dimensional data.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Measures of algorithmic fairness are usually discussed in the context of binary decisions. We extend the approach to continuous scores. So far, ROC-based measures have mainly been suggested for this purpose. Other existing methods depend heavily on the distribution of scores, are unsuitable for ranking tasks, or their effect sizes are not interpretable. Here, we propose a distributionally invariant version of fairness measures for continuous scores with a reasonable interpretation based on the Wasserstein distance. Our measures are easily computable and well suited for quantifying and interpreting the strength of group disparities as well as for comparing biases across different models, datasets, or time points. We derive a link between the different families of existing fairness measures for scores and show that the proposed distributionally invariant fairness measures outperform ROC-based fairness measures because they are more explicit and can quantify significant biases that ROC-based fairness measures miss. Finally, we demonstrate their effectiveness through experiments on the most commonly used fairness benchmark datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Modeling long-term context in videos is crucial for many fine-grained tasks including temporal action segmentation. An interesting question that is still open is how much long-term temporal context is needed for optimal performance. While transformers can model the long-term context of a video, this becomes computationally prohibitive for long videos. Recent works on temporal action segmentation thus combine temporal convolutional networks with self-attentions that are computed only for a local temporal window. While these approaches show good results, their performance is limited by their inability to capture the full context of a video. In this work, we try to answer how much long-term temporal context is required for temporal action segmentation by introducing a transformer-based model that leverages sparse attention to capture the full context of a video. We compare our model with the current state of the art on three datasets for temporal action segmentation, namely 50Salads, Breakfast, and Assembly101. Our experiments show that modeling the full context of a video is necessary to obtain the best performance for temporal action segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Collecting diverse sets of training images for RGB-D semantic image segmentation is not always possible. In particular, when robots need to operate in privacy-sensitive areas like homes, the collection is often limited to a small set of locations. As a consequence, the annotated images lack diversity in appearance and approaches for RGB-D semantic image segmentation tend to overfit the training data. In this paper, we thus introduce semantic RGB-D image synthesis to address this problem. It requires synthesising a realistic-looking RGB-D image for a given semantic label map. Current approaches, however, are uni-modal and cannot cope with multi-modal data. Indeed, we show that extending uni-modal approaches to multi-modal data does not perform well. In this paper, we therefore propose a generator for multi-modal data that separates modal-independent information of the semantic layout from the modal-dependent information that is needed to generate an RGB and a depth image, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a discriminator that ensures semantic consistency between the label maps and the generated images and perceptual similarity between the real and generated images. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous uni-modal methods by a large margin and that the accuracy of an approach for RGB-D semantic segmentation can be significantly improved by mixing real and generated images during training.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Building AIs with adaptive behaviors in human-AI cooperation stands as a pivotal focus in AGI research. Current methods for developing cooperative agents predominantly rely on learning-based methods, where policy generalization heavily hinges on past interactions with specific teammates. These approaches constrain the agent’s capacity to recalibrate its strategy when confronted with novel teammates. We propose \textbf{ProAgent}, a novel framework that harnesses large language models (LLMs) to fashion a \textit{pro}active \textit{agent} empowered with the ability to anticipate teammates’ forthcoming decisions and formulate enhanced plans for itself. ProAgent excels at cooperative reasoning with the capacity to dynamically adapt its behavior to enhance collaborative efforts with teammates. Moreover, the ProAgent framework exhibits a high degree of modularity and interpretability, facilitating seamless integration to address a wide array of coordination scenarios. Experimental evaluations conducted within the framework of \textit{Overcook-AI} unveil the remarkable performance superiority of ProAgent, outperforming five methods based on self-play and population-based training in cooperation with AI agents. Further, when cooperating with human proxy models, its performance exhibits an average improvement exceeding 10% compared to the current state-of-the-art, COLE. The advancement was consistently observed across diverse scenarios involving interactions with both AI agents of varying characteristics and human counterparts. These findings inspire future research for human-robot collaborations.

<p>Abstract:<br>Reinforcement learning serves as a potent tool for modeling dynamic user interests within recommender systems, garnering increasing research attention of late. However, a significant drawback persists: its poor data efficiency, stemming from its interactive nature. The training of reinforcement learning-based recommender systems demands expensive online interactions to amass adequate trajectories, essential for agents to learn user preferences. This inefficiency renders reinforcement learning-based recommender systems a formidable undertaking, necessitating the exploration of potential solutions. Recent strides in offline reinforcement learning present a new perspective. Offline reinforcement learning empowers agents to glean insights from offline datasets and deploy learned policies in online settings. Given that recommender systems possess extensive offline datasets, the framework of offline reinforcement learning aligns seamlessly. Despite being a burgeoning field, works centered on recommender systems utilizing offline reinforcement learning remain limited. This survey aims to introduce and delve into offline reinforcement learning within recommender systems, offering an inclusive review of existing literature in this domain. Furthermore, we strive to underscore prevalent challenges, opportunities, and future pathways, poised to propel research in this evolving field.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Cross-modal pre-training has shown impressive performance on a wide range of downstream tasks, benefiting from massive image-text pairs collected from the Internet. In practice, online data are growing constantly, highlighting the importance of the ability of pre-trained model to learn from data that is continuously growing. Existing works on cross-modal pre-training mainly focus on training a network with fixed architecture. However, it is impractical to limit the model capacity when considering the continuously growing nature of pre-training data in real-world applications. On the other hand, it is important to utilize the knowledge in the current model to obtain efficient training and better performance. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose GrowCLIP, a data-driven automatic model growing algorithm for contrastive language-image pre-training with continuous image-text pairs as input. Specially, we adopt a dynamic growth space and seek out the optimal architecture at each growth step to adapt to online learning scenarios. And the shared encoder is proposed in our growth space to enhance the degree of cross-modal fusion. Besides, we explore the effect of growth in different dimensions, which could provide future references for the design of cross-modal model architecture. Finally, we employ parameter inheriting with momentum (PIM) to maintain the previous knowledge and address the issue of the local minimum dilemma. Compared with the existing methods, GrowCLIP improves 2.3% average top-1 accuracy on zero-shot image classification of 9 downstream tasks. As for zero-shot image retrieval, GrowCLIP can improve 1.2% for top-1 image-to-text recall on Flickr30K dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper illustrates how generative AI could give opportunities for big productivity gains but also opens up questions about the impact of these new powerful technologies on the way we work and share knowledge. More specifically, we explore how ChatGPT changed a fundamental aspect of coding: problem-solving. To do so, we exploit the effect of the sudden release of ChatGPT on the 30th of November 2022 on the usage of the largest online community for coders: Stack Overflow. Using quasi-experimental methods (Difference-in-Difference), we find a significant drop in the number of questions. In addition, the questions are better documented after the release of ChatGPT. Finally, we find evidence that the remaining questions are more complex. These findings suggest not only productivity gains but also a fundamental change in the way we work where routine inquiries are solved by AI allowing humans to focus on more complex tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The quality of a wood log in the wood industry depends heavily on the presence of both outer and inner defects, including inner knots that are a result of the growth of tree branches. Today, locating the inner knots require the use of expensive equipment such as X-ray scanners. In this paper, we address the task of predicting the location of inner defects from the outer shape of the logs. The dataset is built by extracting both the contours and the knots with X-ray measurements. We propose to solve this binary segmentation task by leveraging convolutional recurrent neural networks. Once the neural network is trained, inference can be performed from the outer shape measured with cheap devices such as laser profilers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on fir and spruce tree species and perform ablation on the recurrence to demonstrate its importance.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Understanding the dynamics of large quantum systems is hindered by the curse of dimensionality. Statistical learning offers new possibilities in this regime by neural-network protocols and classical shadows, while both methods have limitations: the former is plagued by the predictive uncertainty and the latter lacks the generalization ability. Here we propose a data-centric learning paradigm combining the strength of these two approaches to facilitate diverse quantum system learning (QSL) tasks. Particularly, our paradigm utilizes classical shadows along with other easily obtainable information of quantum systems to create the training dataset, which is then learnt by neural networks to unveil the underlying mapping rule of the explored QSL problem. Capitalizing on the generalization power of neural networks, this paradigm can be trained offline and excel at predicting previously unseen systems at the inference stage, even with few state copies. Besides, it inherits the characteristic of classical shadows, enabling memory-efficient storage and faithful prediction. These features underscore the immense potential of the proposed data-centric approach in discovering novel and large-scale quantum systems. For concreteness, we present the instantiation of our paradigm in quantum state tomography and direct fidelity estimation tasks and conduct numerical analysis up to 60 qubits. Our work showcases the profound prospects of data-centric artificial intelligence to advance QSL in a faithful and generalizable manner.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Motivated by the challenges of the Digital Ancient Near Eastern Studies (DANES) community, we develop digital tools for processing cuneiform script being a 3D script imprinted into clay tablets used for more than three millennia and at least eight major languages. It consists of thousands of characters that have changed over time and space. Photographs are the most common representations usable for machine learning, while ink drawings are prone to interpretation. Best suited 3D datasets that are becoming available. We created and used the HeiCuBeDa and MaiCuBeDa datasets, which consist of around 500 annotated tablets. For our novel OCR-like approach to mixed image data, we provide an additional mapping tool for transferring annotations between 3D renderings and photographs. Our sign localization uses a RepPoints detector to predict the locations of characters as bounding boxes. We use image data from GigaMesh’s MSII (curvature, see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gigamesh.eu/">https://gigamesh.eu</a>) based rendering, Phong-shaded 3D models, and photographs as well as illumination augmentation. The results show that using rendered 3D images for sign detection performs better than other work on photographs. In addition, our approach gives reasonably good results for photographs only, while it is best used for mixed datasets. More importantly, the Phong renderings, and especially the MSII renderings, improve the results on photographs, which is the largest dataset on a global scale.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Text-to-music generation (T2M-Gen) faces a major obstacle due to the scarcity of large-scale publicly available music datasets with natural language captions. To address this, we propose the Music Understanding LLaMA (MU-LLaMA), capable of answering music-related questions and generating captions for music files. Our model utilizes audio representations from a pretrained MERT model to extract music features. However, obtaining a suitable dataset for training the MU-LLaMA model remains challenging, as existing publicly accessible audio question answering datasets lack the necessary depth for open-ended music question answering. To fill this gap, we present a methodology for generating question-answer pairs from existing audio captioning datasets and introduce the MusicQA Dataset designed for answering open-ended music-related questions. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed MU-LLaMA model, trained on our designed MusicQA dataset, achieves outstanding performance in both music question answering and music caption generation across various metrics, outperforming current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in both fields and offering a promising advancement in the T2M-Gen research field.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The robust constrained Markov decision process (RCMDP) is a recent task-modelling framework for reinforcement learning that incorporates behavioural constraints and that provides robustness to errors in the transition dynamics model through the use of an uncertainty set. Simulating RCMDPs requires computing the worst-case dynamics based on value estimates for each state, an approach which has previously been used in the Robust Constrained Policy Gradient (RCPG). Highlighting potential downsides of RCPG such as not robustifying the full constrained objective and the lack of incremental learning, this paper introduces two algorithms, called RCPG with Robust Lagrangian and Adversarial RCPG. RCPG with Robust Lagrangian modifies RCPG by taking the worst-case dynamics based on the Lagrangian rather than either the value or the constraint. Adversarial RCPG also formulates the worst-case dynamics based on the Lagrangian but learns this directly and incrementally as an adversarial policy through gradient descent rather than indirectly and abruptly through constrained optimisation on a sorted value list. A theoretical analysis first derives the Lagrangian policy gradient for the policy optimisation of both proposed algorithms and then the adversarial policy gradient to learn the adversary for Adversarial RCPG. Empirical experiments injecting perturbations in inventory management and safe navigation tasks demonstrate the competitive performance of both algorithms compared to traditional RCPG variants as well as non-robust and non-constrained ablations. In particular, Adversarial RCPG ranks among the top two performing algorithms on all tests.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>No-regret algorithms are popular for learning Nash equilibrium (NE) in two-player zero-sum normal-form games (NFGs) and extensive-form games (EFGs). Many recent works consider the last-iterate convergence no-regret algorithms. Among them, the two most famous algorithms are Optimistic Gradient Descent Ascent (OGDA) and Optimistic Multiplicative Weight Update (OMWU). However, OGDA has high per-iteration complexity. OMWU exhibits a lower per-iteration complexity but poorer empirical performance, and its convergence holds only when NE is unique. Recent works propose a Reward Transformation (RT) framework for MWU, which removes the uniqueness condition and achieves competitive performance with OMWU. Unfortunately, RT-based algorithms perform worse than OGDA under the same number of iterations, and their convergence guarantee is based on the continuous-time feedback assumption, which does not hold in most scenarios. To address these issues, we provide a closer analysis of the RT framework, which holds for both continuous and discrete-time feedback. We demonstrate that the essence of the RT framework is to transform the problem of learning NE in the original game into a series of strongly convex-concave optimization problems (SCCPs). We show that the bottleneck of RT-based algorithms is the speed of solving SCCPs. To improve the their empirical performance, we design a novel transformation method to enable the SCCPs can be solved by Regret Matching+ (RM+), a no-regret algorithm with better empirical performance, resulting in Reward Transformation RM+ (RTRM+). RTRM+ enjoys last-iterate convergence under the discrete-time feedback setting. Using the counterfactual regret decomposition framework, we propose Reward Transformation CFR+ (RTCFR+) to extend RTRM+ to EFGs. Experimental results show that our algorithms significantly outperform existing last-iterate convergence algorithms and RM+ (CFR+).</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Current research on bias in machine learning often focuses on fairness, while overlooking the roots or causes of bias. However, bias was originally defined as a “systematic error,” often caused by humans at different stages of the research process. This article aims to bridge the gap between past literature on bias in research by providing taxonomy for potential sources of bias and errors in data and models. The paper focus on bias in machine learning pipelines. Survey analyses over forty potential sources of bias in the machine learning (ML) pipeline, providing clear examples for each. By understanding the sources and consequences of bias in machine learning, better methods can be developed for its detecting and mitigating, leading to fairer, more transparent, and more accurate ML models.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Tablature notation is widely used in popular music to transcribe and share guitar musical content. As a complement to standard score notation, tablatures transcribe performance gesture information including finger positions and a variety of guitar-specific playing techniques such as slides, hammer-on&#x2F;pull-off or bends.This paper focuses on bends, which enable to progressively shift the pitch of a note, therefore circumventing physical limitations of the discrete fretted fingerboard. In this paper, we propose a set of 25 high-level features, computed for each note of the tablature, to study how bend occurrences can be predicted from their past and future short-term context. Experiments are performed on a corpus of 932 lead guitar tablatures of popular music and show that a decision tree successfully predicts bend occurrences with an F1 score of 0.71 anda limited amount of false positive predictions, demonstrating promising applications to assist the arrangement of non-guitar music into guitar tablatures.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Fault diagnosis is an essential component in process supervision. Indeed, it determines which kind of fault has occurred, given that it has been previously detected, allowing for appropriate intervention. Automatic fault diagnosis systems use machine learning for predicting the fault type from sensor readings. Nonetheless, these models are sensible to changes in the data distributions, which may be caused by changes in the monitored process, such as changes in the mode of operation. This scenario is known as Cross-Domain Fault Diagnosis (CDFD). We provide an extensive comparison of single and multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation (SSDA and MSDA respectively) algorithms for CDFD. We study these methods in the context of the Tennessee-Eastmann Process, a widely used benchmark in the chemical industry. We show that using multiple domains during training has a positive effect, even when no adaptation is employed. As such, the MSDA baseline improves over the SSDA baseline classification accuracy by 23% on average. In addition, under the multiple-sources scenario, we improve classification accuracy of the no adaptation setting by 8.4% on average.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>3D scene graphs hierarchically represent the environment appropriately organizing different environmental entities in various layers. Our previous work on situational graphs extends the concept of 3D scene graph to SLAM by tightly coupling the robot poses with the scene graph entities, achieving state-of-the-art results. Though, one of the limitations of S-Graphs is scalability in really large environments due to the increased graph size over time, increasing the computational complexity.   To overcome this limitation in this work we present an initial research of an improved version of S-Graphs exploiting the hierarchy to reduce the graph size by marginalizing redundant robot poses and their connections to the observations of the same structural entities. Firstly, we propose the generation and optimization of room-local graphs encompassing all graph entities within a room-like structure. These room-local graphs are used to compress the S-Graphs marginalizing the redundant robot keyframes within the given room. We then perform windowed local optimization of the compressed graph at regular time-distance intervals. A global optimization of the compressed graph is performed every time a loop closure is detected. We show similar accuracy compared to the baseline while showing a 39.81% reduction in the computation time with respect to the baseline.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Wav2vec2 has achieved success in applying Transformer architecture and self-supervised learning to speech recognition. Recently, these have come to be used not only for speech recognition but also for the entire speech processing. This paper introduces an effective end-to-end speaker identification model applied Transformer-based contextual model. We explored the relationship between the parameters and the performance in order to discern the structure of an effective model. Furthermore, we propose a pooling method, Temporal Gate Pooling, with powerful learning ability for speaker identification. We applied Conformer as encoder and BEST-RQ for pre-training and conducted an evaluation utilizing the speaker identification of VoxCeleb1. The proposed method has achieved an accuracy of 85.9% with 28.5M parameters, demonstrating comparable precision to wav2vec2 with 317.7M parameters.

<p>Abstract:<br>In this paper, we argue that the next generation of robots can be commanded using only Language Models’ prompts. Every prompt interrogates separately a specific Robotic Modality via its Modality Language Model (MLM). A central Task Modality mediates the whole communication to execute the robotic mission via a Large Language Model (LLM). This paper gives this new robotic design pattern the name of: Prompting Robotic Modalities (PRM). Moreover, this paper applies this PRM design pattern in building a new robotic framework named ROSGPT_Vision. ROSGPT_Vision allows the execution of a robotic task using only two prompts: a Visual and an LLM prompt. The Visual Prompt extracts, in natural language, the visual semantic features related to the task under consideration (Visual Robotic Modality). Meanwhile, the LLM Prompt regulates the robotic reaction to the visual description (Task Modality). The framework automates all the mechanisms behind these two prompts. The framework enables the robot to address complex real-world scenarios by processing visual data, making informed decisions, and carrying out actions automatically. The framework comprises one generic vision module and two independent ROS nodes. As a test application, we used ROSGPT_Vision to develop CarMate, which monitors the driver’s distraction on the roads and makes real-time vocal notifications to the driver. We showed how ROSGPT_Vision significantly reduced the development cost compared to traditional methods. We demonstrated how to improve the quality of the application by optimizing the prompting strategies, without delving into technical details. ROSGPT_Vision is shared with the community (link: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/bilel-bj/ROSGPT_Vision">https://github.com/bilel-bj/ROSGPT_Vision</a>) to advance robotic research in this direction and to build more robotic frameworks that implement the PRM design pattern and enables controlling robots using only prompts.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has found wide application, but also poses risks due to unintentional or malicious tampering during deployment. Regular checks are therefore necessary to detect and prevent such risks. Fragile watermarking is a technique used to identify tampering in AI models. However, previous methods have faced challenges including risks of omission, additional information transmission, and inability to locate tampering precisely. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting tampered parameters and bits, which can be used to detect, locate, and restore parameters that have been tampered with. We also propose an adaptive embedding method that maximizes information capacity while maintaining model accuracy. Our approach was tested on multiple neural networks subjected to attacks that modified weight parameters, and our results demonstrate that our method achieved great recovery performance when the modification rate was below 20%. Furthermore, for models where watermarking significantly affected accuracy, we utilized an adaptive bit technique to recover more than 15% of the accuracy loss of the model.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a fundamental problem in robotics that asks us to compute collision-free paths for a team of agents, all moving across a shared map. Although many works appear on this topic, all current algorithms struggle as the number of agents grows. The principal reason is that existing approaches typically plan free-flow optimal paths, which creates congestion. To tackle this issue we propose a new approach for MAPF where agents are guided to their destination by following congestion-avoiding paths. We evaluate the idea in two large-scale settings: one-shot MAPF, where each agent has a single destination, and lifelong MAPF, where agents are continuously assigned new tasks. For one-shot MAPF we show that our approach substantially improves solution quality. For Lifelong MAPF we report large improvements in overall throughput.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Information Technology has become a critical component in various industries, leading to an increased focus on software maintenance and monitoring. With the complexities of modern software systems, traditional maintenance approaches have become insufficient. The concept of AIOps has emerged to enhance predictive maintenance using Big Data and Machine Learning capabilities. However, exploiting AIOps requires addressing several challenges related to the complexity of data and incident management. Commercial solutions exist, but they may not be suitable for certain companies due to high costs, data governance issues, and limitations in covering private software. This paper investigates the feasibility of implementing on-premise AIOps solutions by leveraging open-source tools. We introduce a comprehensive AIOps infrastructure that we have successfully deployed in our company, and we provide the rationale behind different choices that we made to build its various components. Particularly, we provide insights into our approach and criteria for selecting a data management system and we explain its integration. Our experience can be beneficial for companies seeking to internally manage their software maintenance processes with a modern AIOps approach.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered considerable interest within both academic and industrial. Yet, the application of LLMs to graph data remains under-explored. In this study, we evaluate the capabilities of four LLMs in addressing several analytical problems with graph data. We employ four distinct evaluation metrics: Comprehension, Correctness, Fidelity, and Rectification. Our results show that: 1) LLMs effectively comprehend graph data in natural language and reason with graph topology. 2) GPT models can generate logical and coherent results, outperforming alternatives in correctness. 3) All examined LLMs face challenges in structural reasoning, with techniques like zero-shot chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting showing diminished efficacy. 4) GPT models often produce erroneous answers in multi-answer tasks, raising concerns in fidelity. 5) GPT models exhibit elevated confidence in their outputs, potentially hindering their rectification capacities. Notably, GPT-4 has demonstrated the capacity to rectify responses from GPT-3.5-turbo and its own previous iterations.

<p>Abstract:<br>The field of women’s endocrinology has trailed behind data-driven medical solutions, largely due to concerns over the privacy of patient data. Valuable datapoints about hormone levels or menstrual cycling could expose patients who suffer from comorbidities or terminate a pregnancy, violating their privacy. We explore the application of Federated Learning (FL) to predict the optimal drug for patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a serious hormonal disorder impacting millions of women worldwide, yet it’s poorly understood and its research is stunted by a lack of patient data. We demonstrate that a variety of FL approaches succeed on a synthetic PCOS patient dataset. Our proposed FL models are a tool to access massive quantities of diverse data and identify the most effective treatment option while providing PCOS patients with privacy guarantees.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Multimodal data, which can comprehensively perceive and recognize the physical world, has become an essential path towards general artificial intelligence. However, multimodal large models trained on public datasets often underperform in specific industrial domains. This paper proposes a multimodal federated learning framework that enables multiple enterprises to utilize private domain data to collaboratively train large models for vertical domains, achieving intelligent services across scenarios. The authors discuss in-depth the strategic transformation of federated learning in terms of intelligence foundation and objectives in the era of big model, as well as the new challenges faced in heterogeneous data, model aggregation, performance and cost trade-off, data privacy, and incentive mechanism. The paper elaborates a case study of leading enterprises contributing multimodal data and expert knowledge to city safety operation management , including distributed deployment and efficient coordination of the federated learning platform, technical innovations on data quality improvement based on large model capabilities and efficient joint fine-tuning approaches. Preliminary experiments show that enterprises can enhance and accumulate intelligent capabilities through multimodal model federated learning, thereby jointly creating an smart city model that provides high-quality intelligent services covering energy infrastructure safety, residential community security, and urban operation management. The established federated learning cooperation ecosystem is expected to further aggregate industry, academia, and research resources, realize large models in multiple vertical domains, and promote the large-scale industrial application of artificial intelligence and cutting-edge research on multimodal federated learning.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Transformers have demonstrated tremendous success not only in the natural language processing (NLP) domain but also the field of computer vision, igniting various creative approaches and applications. Yet, the superior performance and modeling flexibility of transformers came with a severe increase in computation costs, and hence several works have proposed methods to reduce this burden. Inspired by a cost-cutting method originally proposed for language models, Data Multiplexing (DataMUX), we propose a novel approach for efficient visual recognition that employs additional dim1 batching (i.e., concatenation) that greatly improves the throughput with little compromise in the accuracy. We first introduce a naive adaptation of DataMux for vision models, Image Multiplexer, and devise novel components to overcome its weaknesses, rendering our final model, ConcatPlexer, at the sweet spot between inference speed and accuracy. The ConcatPlexer was trained on ImageNet1K and CIFAR100 dataset and it achieved 23.5% less GFLOPs than ViT-B&#x2F;16 with 69.5% and 83.4% validation accuracy, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP and ALIGN, are generally trained on datasets consisting of image-caption pairs obtained from the web. However, real-world multimodal datasets, such as healthcare data, are significantly more complex: each image (e.g. X-ray) is often paired with text (e.g. physician report) that describes many distinct attributes occurring in fine-grained regions of the image. We refer to these samples as exhibiting high pairwise complexity, since each image-text pair can be decomposed into a large number of region-attribute pairings. The extent to which VLMs can capture fine-grained relationships between image regions and textual attributes when trained on such data has not been previously evaluated. The first key contribution of this work is to demonstrate through systematic evaluations that as the pairwise complexity of the training dataset increases, standard VLMs struggle to learn region-attribute relationships, exhibiting performance degradations of up to 37% on retrieval tasks. In order to address this issue, we introduce ViLLA as our second key contribution. ViLLA, which is trained to capture fine-grained region-attribute relationships from complex datasets, involves two components: (a) a lightweight, self-supervised mapping model to decompose image-text samples into region-attribute pairs, and (b) a contrastive VLM to learn representations from generated region-attribute pairs. We demonstrate with experiments across four domains (synthetic, product, medical, and natural images) that ViLLA outperforms comparable VLMs on fine-grained reasoning tasks, such as zero-shot object detection (up to 3.6 AP50 points on COCO and 0.6 mAP points on LVIS) and retrieval (up to 14.2 R-Precision points).</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Error prediction in large language models often relies on domain-specific information. In this paper, we present measures for quantification of error in the response of a large language model based on the diversity of responses to a given prompt - hence independent of the underlying application. We describe how three such measures - based on entropy, Gini impurity, and centroid distance - can be employed. We perform a suite of experiments on multiple datasets and temperature settings to demonstrate that these measures strongly correlate with the probability of failure. Additionally, we present empirical results demonstrating how these measures can be applied to few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and error detection.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The goal of sequential recommendation (SR) is to predict a user’s potential interested items based on her&#x2F;his historical interaction sequences. Most existing sequential recommenders are developed based on ID features, which, despite their widespread use, often underperform with sparse IDs and struggle with the cold-start problem. Besides, inconsistent ID mappings hinder the model’s transferability, isolating similar recommendation domains that could have been co-optimized. This paper aims to address these issues by exploring the potential of multi-modal information in learning robust and generalizable sequence representations. We propose MISSRec, a multi-modal pre-training and transfer learning framework for SR. On the user side, we design a Transformer-based encoder-decoder model, where the contextual encoder learns to capture the sequence-level multi-modal synergy while a novel interest-aware decoder is developed to grasp item-modality-interest relations for better sequence representation. On the candidate item side, we adopt a dynamic fusion module to produce user-adaptive item representation, providing more precise matching between users and items. We pre-train the model with contrastive learning objectives and fine-tune it in an efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of MISSRec, promising an practical solution for real-world recommendation scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Impressive performance on point cloud semantic segmentation has been achieved by fully-supervised methods with large amounts of labelled data. As it is labour-intensive to acquire large-scale point cloud data with point-wise labels, many attempts have been made to explore learning 3D point cloud segmentation with limited annotations. Active learning is one of the effective strategies to achieve this purpose but is still under-explored. The most recent methods of this kind measure the uncertainty of each pre-divided region for manual labelling but they suffer from redundant information and require additional efforts for region division. This paper aims at addressing this issue by developing a hierarchical point-based active learning strategy. Specifically, we measure the uncertainty for each point by a hierarchical minimum margin uncertainty module which considers the contextual information at multiple levels. Then, a feature-distance suppression strategy is designed to select important and representative points for manual labelling. Besides, to better exploit the unlabelled data, we build a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on our active strategy. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNetV2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves 96.5% and 100% performance of fully-supervised baseline with only 0.07% and 0.1% training data, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art weakly-supervised and active learning methods.

<p>Abstract:<br>Neural force fields (NFFs) have gained prominence in computational chemistry as surrogate models, superseding quantum-chemistry calculations in ab initio molecular dynamics. The prevalent benchmark for NFFs has been the MD17 dataset and its subsequent extension. These datasets predominantly comprise geometries from the equilibrium region of the ground electronic state potential energy surface, sampling from direct adiabatic dynamics. However, many chemical reactions entail significant molecular deformations, notably bond breaking. We demonstrate the constrained distribution of internal coordinates and energies in the MD17 datasets, underscoring their inadequacy for representing systems undergoing chemical reactions. Addressing this sampling limitation, we introduce the xxMD (Extended Excited-state Molecular Dynamics) dataset, derived from non-adiabatic dynamics. This dataset encompasses energies and forces ascertained from both multireference wave function theory and density functional theory. Furthermore, its nuclear configuration spaces authentically depict chemical reactions, making xxMD a more chemically relevant dataset. Our re-assessment of equivariant models on the xxMD datasets reveals notably higher mean absolute errors than those reported for MD17 and its variants. This observation underscores the challenges faced in crafting a generalizable NFF model with extrapolation capability.

<p>Abstract:<br>The success of supervised deep learning models on cell recognition tasks relies on detailed annotations. Many previous works have managed to reduce the dependency on labels. However, considering the large number of cells contained in a patch, costly and inefficient labeling is still inevitable. To this end, we explored label-free methods for cell recognition. Prior self-activation maps (PSM) are proposed to generate pseudo masks as training targets. To be specific, an activation network is trained with self-supervised learning. The gradient information in the shallow layers of the network is aggregated to generate prior self-activation maps. Afterward, a semantic clustering module is then introduced as a pipeline to transform PSMs to pixel-level semantic pseudo masks for downstream tasks. We evaluated our method on two histological datasets: MoNuSeg (cell segmentation) and BCData (multi-class cell detection). Compared with other fully-supervised and weakly-supervised methods, our method can achieve competitive performance without any manual annotations. Our simple but effective framework can also achieve multi-class cell detection which can not be done by existing unsupervised methods. The results show the potential of PSMs that might inspire other research to deal with the hunger for labels in medical area.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>With large language models (LLMs) achieving remarkable breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP) domains, LLM-enhanced recommender systems have received much attention and have been actively explored currently. In this paper, we focus on adapting and empowering a pure large language model for zero-shot and few-shot recommendation tasks. First and foremost, we identify and formulate the lifelong sequential behavior incomprehension problem for LLMs in recommendation domains, i.e., LLMs fail to extract useful information from a textual context of long user behavior sequence, even if the length of context is far from reaching the context limitation of LLMs. To address such an issue and improve the recommendation performance of LLMs, we propose a novel framework, namely Retrieval-enhanced Large Language models (ReLLa) for recommendation tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. For zero-shot recommendation, we perform semantic user behavior retrieval (SUBR) to improve the data quality of testing samples, which greatly reduces the difficulty for LLMs to extract the essential knowledge from user behavior sequences. As for few-shot recommendation, we further design retrieval-enhanced instruction tuning (ReiT) by adopting SUBR as a data augmentation technique for training samples. Specifically, we develop a mixed training dataset consisting of both the original data samples and their retrieval-enhanced counterparts. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world public dataset (i.e., MovieLens-1M) to demonstrate the superiority of ReLLa compared with existing baseline models, as well as its capability for lifelong sequential behavior comprehension.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Graph transformers need strong inductive biases to derive meaningful attention scores. Yet, current proposals rarely address methods capturing longer ranges, hierarchical structures, or community structures, as they appear in various graphs such as molecules, social networks, and citation networks. In this paper, we propose a hierarchy-distance structural encoding (HDSE), which models a hierarchical distance between the nodes in a graph focusing on its multi-level, hierarchical nature. In particular, this yields a framework which can be flexibly integrated with existing graph transformers, allowing for simultaneous application with other positional representations. Through extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our HDSE method successfully enhances various types of baseline transformers, achieving state-of-the-art empirical performances on 10 benchmark datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The Automated Model Evaluation (AutoEval) framework entertains the possibility of evaluating a trained machine learning model without resorting to a labeled testing set. Despite the promise and some decent results, the existing AutoEval methods heavily rely on computing distribution shifts between the unlabelled testing set and the training set. We believe this reliance on the training set becomes another obstacle in shipping this technology to real-world ML development. In this work, we propose Contrastive Automatic Model Evaluation (CAME), a novel AutoEval framework that is rid of involving training set in the loop. The core idea of CAME bases on a theoretical analysis which bonds the model performance with a contrastive loss. Further, with extensive empirical validation, we manage to set up a predictable relationship between the two, simply by deducing on the unlabeled&#x2F;unseen testing set. The resulting framework CAME establishes a new SOTA results for AutoEval by surpassing prior work significantly.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Anonymity of both natural and legal persons in court rulings is a critical aspect of privacy protection in the European Union and Switzerland. With the advent of LLMs, concerns about large-scale re-identification of anonymized persons are growing. In accordance with the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland, we explore the potential of LLMs to re-identify individuals in court rulings by constructing a proof-of-concept using actual legal data from the Swiss federal supreme court. Following the initial experiment, we constructed an anonymized Wikipedia dataset as a more rigorous testing ground to further investigate the findings. With the introduction and application of the new task of re-identifying people in texts, we also introduce new metrics to measure performance. We systematically analyze the factors that influence successful re-identifications, identifying model size, input length, and instruction tuning among the most critical determinants. Despite high re-identification rates on Wikipedia, even the best LLMs struggled with court decisions. The complexity is attributed to the lack of test datasets, the necessity for substantial training resources, and data sparsity in the information used for re-identification. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that re-identification using LLMs may not be feasible for now, but as the proof-of-concept on Wikipedia showed, it might become possible in the future. We hope that our system can help enhance the confidence in the security of anonymized decisions, thus leading to the courts being more confident to publish decisions.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Automatic modulation classification (AMC) plays a critical role in wireless communications by autonomously classifying signals transmitted over the radio spectrum. Deep learning (DL) techniques are increasingly being used for AMC due to their ability to extract complex wireless signal features. However, DL models are computationally intensive and incur high inference latencies. This paper proposes the application of early exiting (EE) techniques for DL models used for AMC to accelerate inference. We present and analyze four early exiting architectures and a customized multi-branch training algorithm for this problem. Through extensive experimentation, we show that signals with moderate to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are easier to classify, do not require deep architectures, and can therefore leverage the proposed EE architectures. Our experimental results demonstrate that EE techniques can significantly reduce the inference speed of deep neural networks without sacrificing classification accuracy. We also thoroughly study the trade-off between classification accuracy and inference time when using these architectures. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first attempt to apply early exiting methods to AMC, providing a foundation for future research in this area.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We present an architecture and a training recipe that adapts pre-trained open-world image models to localization in videos. Understanding the open visual world (without being constrained by fixed label spaces) is crucial for many real-world vision tasks. Contrastive pre-training on large image-text datasets has recently led to significant improvements for image-level tasks. For more structured tasks involving object localization applying pre-trained models is more challenging. This is particularly true for video tasks, where task-specific data is limited. We show successful transfer of open-world models by building on the OWL-ViT open-vocabulary detection model and adapting it to video by adding a transformer decoder. The decoder propagates object representations recurrently through time by using the output tokens for one frame as the object queries for the next. Our model is end-to-end trainable on video data and enjoys improved temporal consistency compared to tracking-by-detection baselines, while retaining the open-world capabilities of the backbone detector. We evaluate our model on the challenging TAO-OW benchmark and demonstrate that open-world capabilities, learned from large-scale image-text pre-training, can be transferred successfully to open-world localization across diverse videos.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Efficiently obtaining the up-to-date information in the disaster-stricken area is the key to successful disaster response. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), workers and cars can collaborate to accomplish sensing tasks, such as data collection, in disaster-stricken areas. In this paper, we explicitly address the route planning for a group of agents, including UAVs, workers, and cars, with the goal of maximizing the task completion rate. We propose MANF-RL-RP, a heterogeneous multi-agent route planning algorithm that incorporates several efficient designs, including global-local dual information processing and a tailored model structure for heterogeneous multi-agent systems. Global-local dual information processing encompasses the extraction and dissemination of spatial features from global information, as well as the partitioning and filtering of local information from individual agents. Regarding the construction of the model structure for heterogeneous multi-agent, we perform the following work. We design the same data structure to represent the states of different agents, prove the Markovian property of the decision-making process of agents to simplify the model structure, and also design a reasonable reward function to train the model. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on the rich simulation data. In comparison to the baseline algorithms, namely Greedy-SC-RP and MANF-DNN-RP, MANF-RL-RP has exhibited a significant improvement in terms of task completion rate.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Multi-agent interactions, such as communication, teaching, and bluffing, often rely on higher-order social inference, i.e., understanding how others infer oneself. Such intricate reasoning can be effectively modeled through nested multi-agent reasoning. Nonetheless, the computational complexity escalates exponentially with each level of reasoning, posing a significant challenge. However, humans effortlessly perform complex social inferences as part of their daily lives. To bridge the gap between human-like inference capabilities and computational limitations, we propose a novel approach: leveraging neural networks to amortize high-order social inference, thereby expediting nested multi-agent reasoning. We evaluate our method in two challenging multi-agent interaction domains. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is computationally efficient while exhibiting minimal degradation in accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success in various applications including video action recognition, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks (Trojans). The backdoor-compromised model will mis-classify to the target class chosen by the attacker when a test instance (from a non-target class) is embedded with a specific trigger, while maintaining high accuracy on attack-free instances. Although there are extensive studies on backdoor attacks against image data, the susceptibility of video-based systems under backdoor attacks remains largely unexplored. Current studies are direct extensions of approaches proposed for image data, e.g., the triggers are \textbf{independently} embedded within the frames, which tend to be detectable by existing defenses. In this paper, we introduce a \textit{simple} yet \textit{effective} backdoor attack against video data. Our proposed attack, adding perturbations in a transformed domain, plants an \textbf{imperceptible, temporally distributed} trigger across the video frames, and is shown to be resilient to existing defensive strategies. The effectiveness of the proposed attack is demonstrated by extensive experiments with various well-known models on two video recognition benchmarks, UCF101 and HMDB51, and a sign language recognition benchmark, Greek Sign Language (GSL) dataset. We delve into the impact of several influential factors on our proposed attack and identify an intriguing effect termed “collateral damage” through extensive studies.</p>

In this paper we propose a novel TDL-based method for compressing signals over graphs, consisting in two main steps: first, disjoint sets of higher-order structures are inferred based on the original signal –by clustering $N$ datapoints into $K\ll N$ collections; then, a topological-inspired message passing gets a compressed representation of the signal within those multi-element sets. Our results show that our framework improves both standard GNN and feed-forward architectures in compressing temporal link-based signals from two real-word Internet Service Provider Networks’ datasets –from $30%$ up to $90%$ better reconstruction errors across all evaluation scenarios–, suggesting that it better captures and exploits spatial and temporal correlations over the whole graph-based network structure.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Automation of High-Level Context (HLC) reasoning for intelligent systems at scale is imperative due to the unceasing accumulation of contextual data in the IoT era, the trend of the fusion of data from multi-sources, and the intrinsic complexity and dynamism of the context-based decision-making process. To mitigate this issue, we propose an automatic context reasoning framework CSM-H-R, which programmatically combines ontologies and states at runtime and the model-storage phase for attaining the ability to recognize meaningful HLC, and the resulting data representation can be applied to different reasoning techniques. Case studies are developed based on an intelligent elevator system in a smart campus setting. An implementation of the framework - a CSM Engine, and the experiments of translating the HLC reasoning into vector and matrix computing especially take care of the dynamic aspects of context and present the potentiality of using advanced mathematical and probabilistic models to achieve the next level of automation in integrating intelligent systems; meanwhile, privacy protection support is achieved by anonymization through label embedding and reducing information correlation.

<p>Abstract:<br>Recently, foundation models have exhibited remarkable advancements in multi-modal learning. These models, equipped with millions (or billions) of parameters, typically require a substantial amount of data for finetuning. However, collecting and centralizing training data from diverse sectors becomes challenging due to distinct privacy regulations. Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a promising solution, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively train neural networks without centralizing their local data. To alleviate client computation burdens and communication overheads, previous works have adapted Parameter-efficient Finetuning (PEFT) methods for FL. Hereby, only a small fraction of the model parameters are optimized and communicated during federated communications. Nevertheless, most previous works have focused on a single modality and neglected one common phenomenon, i.e., the presence of data heterogeneity across the clients. Therefore, in this work, we propose a finetuning framework tailored to heterogeneous multi-modal FL, called Federated Dual-Aadapter Teacher (FedDAT). Specifically, our approach leverages a Dual-Adapter Teacher (DAT) to address data heterogeneity by regularizing the client local updates and applying Mutual Knowledge Distillation (MKD) for an efficient knowledge transfer. FedDAT is the first approach that enables an efficient distributed finetuning of foundation models for a variety of heterogeneous Vision-Language tasks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on four multi-modality FL benchmarks with different types of data heterogeneity, where FedDAT substantially outperforms the existing centralized PEFT methods adapted for FL.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In recent years, several Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WS3) methods have been proposed that use class activation maps (CAMs) generated by a classifier to produce pseudo-ground truths for training segmentation models. While CAMs are good at highlighting discriminative regions (DR) of an image, they are known to disregard regions of the object that do not contribute to the classifier’s prediction, termed non-discriminative regions (NDR). In contrast, attribution methods such as saliency maps provide an alternative approach for assigning a score to every pixel based on its contribution to the classification prediction. This paper provides a comprehensive comparison between saliencies and CAMs for WS3. Our study includes multiple perspectives on understanding their similarities and dissimilarities. Moreover, we provide new evaluation metrics that perform a comprehensive assessment of WS3 performance of alternative methods w.r.t. CAMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of saliencies in addressing the limitation of CAMs through our empirical studies on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we propose random cropping as a stochastic aggregation technique that improves the performance of saliency, making it a strong alternative to CAM for WS3.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Clinical event sequences consist of hundreds of clinical events that represent records of patient care in time. Developing accurate predictive models of such sequences is of a great importance for supporting a variety of models for interpreting&#x2F;classifying the current patient condition, or predicting adverse clinical events and outcomes, all aimed to improve patient care. One important challenge of learning predictive models of clinical sequences is their patient-specific variability. Based on underlying clinical conditions, each patient’s sequence may consist of different sets of clinical events (observations, lab results, medications, procedures). Hence, simple population-wide models learned from event sequences for many different patients may not accurately predict patient-specific dynamics of event sequences and their differences. To address the problem, we propose and investigate multiple new event sequence prediction models and methods that let us better adjust the prediction for individual patients and their specific conditions. The methods developed in this work pursue refinement of population-wide models to subpopulations, self-adaptation, and a meta-level model switching that is able to adaptively select the model with the best chance to support the immediate prediction. We analyze and test the performance of these models on clinical event sequences of patients in MIMIC-III database.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Firm competition and collusion involve complex dynamics, particularly when considering communication among firms. Such issues can be modeled as problems of complex systems, traditionally approached through experiments involving human subjects or agent-based modeling methods. We propose an innovative framework called Smart Agent-Based Modeling (SABM), wherein smart agents, supported by GPT-4 technologies, represent firms, and interact with one another. We conducted a controlled experiment to study firm price competition and collusion behaviors under various conditions. SABM is more cost-effective and flexible compared to conducting experiments with human subjects. Smart agents possess an extensive knowledge base for decision-making and exhibit human-like strategic abilities, surpassing traditional ABM agents. Furthermore, smart agents can simulate human conversation and be personalized, making them ideal for studying complex situations involving communication. Our results demonstrate that, in the absence of communication, smart agents consistently reach tacit collusion, leading to prices converging at levels higher than the Bertrand equilibrium price but lower than monopoly or cartel prices. When communication is allowed, smart agents achieve a higher-level collusion with prices close to cartel prices. Collusion forms more quickly with communication, while price convergence is smoother without it. These results indicate that communication enhances trust between firms, encouraging frequent small price deviations to explore opportunities for a higher-level win-win situation and reducing the likelihood of triggering a price war. We also assigned different personas to firms to analyze behavioral differences and tested variant models under diverse market structures. The findings showcase the effectiveness and robustness of SABM and provide intriguing insights into competition and collusion.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We tackle the problem of learning complex, general behaviors directly in the real world. We propose an approach for robots to efficiently learn manipulation skills using only a handful of real-world interaction trajectories from many different settings. Inspired by the success of learning from large-scale datasets in the fields of computer vision and natural language, our belief is that in order to efficiently learn, a robot must be able to leverage internet-scale, human video data. Humans interact with the world in many interesting ways, which can allow a robot to not only build an understanding of useful actions and affordances but also how these actions affect the world for manipulation. Our approach builds a structured, human-centric action space grounded in visual affordances learned from human videos. Further, we train a world model on human videos and fine-tune on a small amount of robot interaction data without any task supervision. We show that this approach of affordance-space world models enables different robots to learn various manipulation skills in complex settings, in under 30 minutes of interaction.

<p>Abstract:<br>We introduce TADA, a simple-yet-effective approach that takes textual descriptions and produces expressive 3D avatars with high-quality geometry and lifelike textures, that can be animated and rendered with traditional graphics pipelines. Existing text-based character generation methods are limited in terms of geometry and texture quality, and cannot be realistically animated due to inconsistent alignment between the geometry and the texture, particularly in the face region. To overcome these limitations, TADA leverages the synergy of a 2D diffusion model and an animatable parametric body model. Specifically, we derive an optimizable high-resolution body model from SMPL-X with 3D displacements and a texture map, and use hierarchical rendering with score distillation sampling (SDS) to create high-quality, detailed, holistic 3D avatars from text. To ensure alignment between the geometry and texture, we render normals and RGB images of the generated character and exploit their latent embeddings in the SDS training process. We further introduce various expression parameters to deform the generated character during training, ensuring that the semantics of our generated character remain consistent with the original SMPL-X model, resulting in an animatable character. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that TADA significantly surpasses existing approaches on both qualitative and quantitative measures. TADA enables creation of large-scale digital character assets that are ready for animation and rendering, while also being easily editable through natural language. The code will be public for research purposes.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Modern large language models (LLMs) that rely on attention mechanisms are typically trained with fixed context lengths which enforce upper limits on the length of input sequences that they can handle at evaluation time. To use these models on sequences longer than the train-time context length, one might employ techniques from the growing family of context length extrapolation methods – most of which focus on modifying the system of positional encodings used in the attention mechanism to indicate where tokens or activations are located in the input sequence. We conduct a wide survey of existing methods of context length extrapolation on a base LLaMA or LLaMA 2 model, and introduce some of our own design as well – in particular, a new truncation strategy for modifying the basis for the position encoding.   We test these methods using three new evaluation tasks (FreeFormQA, AlteredNumericQA, and LongChat-Lines) as well as perplexity, which we find to be less fine-grained as a measure of long context performance of LLMs. We release the three tasks publicly as datasets on HuggingFace. We discover that linear scaling is the best method for extending context length, and show that further gains can be achieved by using longer scales at evaluation time. We also discover promising extrapolation capabilities in the truncated basis. To support further research in this area, we release three new 13B parameter long-context models which we call Giraffe: 4k and 16k context models trained from base LLaMA-13B, and a 32k context model trained from base LLaMA2-13B. We also release the code to replicate our results.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Transformer language models exhibit intelligent behaviors such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, acquiring knowledge, reasoning, planning, reflecting and using tools. This paper explores how their underlying mechanics give rise to intelligent behaviors. We adopt a systems approach to analyze Transformers in detail and develop a mathematical framework that frames their dynamics as movement through embedding space. This novel perspective provides a principled way of thinking about the problem and reveals important insights related to the emergence of intelligence:   1. At its core the Transformer is a Embedding Space walker, mapping intelligent behavior to trajectories in this vector space.   2. At each step of the walk, it composes context into a single composite vector whose location in Embedding Space defines the next step.   3. No learning actually occurs during decoding; in-context learning and generalization are simply the result of different contexts composing into different vectors.   4. Ultimately the knowledge, intelligence and skills exhibited by the model are embodied in the organization of vectors in Embedding Space rather than in specific neurons or layers. These abilities are properties of this organization.   5. Attention’s contribution boils down to the association-bias it lends to vector composition and which influences the aforementioned organization. However, more investigation is needed to ascertain its significance.   6. The entire model is composed from two principal operations: data independent filtering and data dependent aggregation. This generalization unifies Transformers with other sequence models and across modalities.   Building upon this foundation we formalize and test a semantic space theory which posits that embedding vectors represent semantic concepts and find some evidence of its validity.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The scarcity of task-labeled time-series benchmarks in the financial domain hinders progress in continual learning. Addressing this deficit would foster innovation in this area. Therefore, we present COB, Crude Oil Benchmark datasets. COB includes 30 years of asset prices that exhibit significant distribution shifts and optimally generates corresponding task (i.e., regime) labels based on these distribution shifts for the three most important crude oils in the world. Our contributions include creating real-world benchmark datasets by transforming asset price data into volatility proxies, fitting models using expectation-maximization (EM), generating contextual task labels that align with real-world events, and providing these labels as well as the general algorithm to the public. We show that the inclusion of these task labels universally improves performance on four continual learning algorithms, some state-of-the-art, over multiple forecasting horizons. We hope these benchmarks accelerate research in handling distribution shifts in real-world data, especially due to the global importance of the assets considered. We’ve made the (1) raw price data, (2) task labels generated by our approach, (3) and code for our algorithm available at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://oilpricebenchmarks.github.io/">https://oilpricebenchmarks.github.io</a>.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Despite the promising results of machine learning models in malware detection, they face the problem of concept drift due to malware constant evolution. This leads to a decline in performance over time, as the data distribution of the new files differs from the training one, requiring regular model update. In this work, we propose a model-agnostic protocol to improve a baseline neural network to handle with the drift problem. We show the importance of feature reduction and training with the most recent validation set possible, and propose a loss function named Drift-Resilient Binary Cross-Entropy, an improvement to the classical Binary Cross-Entropy more effective against drift. We train our model on the EMBER dataset (2018) and evaluate it on a dataset of recent malicious files, collected between 2020 and 2023. Our improved model shows promising results, detecting 15.2% more malware than a baseline model.</p>
