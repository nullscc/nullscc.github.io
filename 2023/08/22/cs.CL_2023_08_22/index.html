<p>Abstract:<br>Our project aims at helping and supporting stakeholders in refugee status adjudications, such as lawyers, judges, governing bodies, and claimants, in order to make better decisions through data-driven intelligence and increase the understanding and transparency of the refugee application process for all involved parties. This PhD project has two primary objectives: (1) to retrieve past cases, and (2) to analyze legal decision-making processes on a dataset of Canadian cases. In this paper, we present the current state of our work, which includes a completed experiment on part (1) and ongoing efforts related to part (2). We believe that NLP-based solutions are well-suited to address these challenges, and we investigate the feasibility of automating all steps involved. In addition, we introduce a novel benchmark for future NLP research in refugee law. Our methodology aims to be inclusive to all end-users and stakeholders, with expected benefits including reduced time-to-decision, fairer and more transparent outcomes, and improved decision quality.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recently, large-scale pre-trained vision-language models (e.g. CLIP and ALIGN) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in acquiring transferable visual representations. To leverage the valuable knowledge encoded within these models for downstream tasks, several fine-tuning approaches, including prompt tuning methods and adapter-based methods, have been developed to adapt vision-language models effectively with supervision. However, these methods rely on the availability of annotated samples, which can be labor-intensive and time-consuming to acquire, thus limiting scalability. To address this issue, in this work, we design an unsupervised fine-tuning approach for vision-language models called Unsupervised Prototype Adapter (UP-Adapter). Specifically, for the unannotated target datasets, we leverage the text-image aligning capability of CLIP to automatically select the most confident samples for each class. Utilizing these selected samples, we generate class prototypes, which serve as the initialization for the learnable prototype model. After fine-tuning, the prototype model prediction is combined with the original CLIP’s prediction by a residual connection to perform downstream recognition tasks. Our extensive experimental results on image recognition and domain generalization show that the proposed unsupervised method outperforms 8-shot CoOp, 8-shot Tip-Adapter, and also the state-of-the-art UPL method by large margins.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Automatically disentangling an author’s style from the content of their writing is a longstanding and possibly insurmountable problem in computational linguistics. At the same time, the availability of large text corpora furnished with author labels has recently enabled learning authorship representations in a purely data-driven manner for authorship attribution, a task that ostensibly depends to a greater extent on encoding writing style than encoding content. However, success on this surrogate task does not ensure that such representations capture writing style since authorship could also be correlated with other latent variables, such as topic. In an effort to better understand the nature of the information these representations convey, and specifically to validate the hypothesis that they chiefly encode writing style, we systematically probe these representations through a series of targeted experiments. The results of these experiments suggest that representations learned for the surrogate authorship prediction task are indeed sensitive to writing style. As a consequence, authorship representations may be expected to be robust to certain kinds of data shift, such as topic drift over time. Additionally, our findings may open the door to downstream applications that require stylistic representations, such as style transfer.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In conversation, speakers produce language incrementally, word by word, while continuously monitoring the appropriateness of their own contribution in the dynamically unfolding context of the conversation; and this often leads them to repair their own utterance on the fly. This real-time language processing capacity is furthermore crucial to the development of fluent and natural conversational AI. In this paper, we use a previously learned Dynamic Syntax grammar and the CHILDES corpus to develop, train and evaluate a probabilistic model for incremental generation where input to the model is a purely semantic generation goal concept in Type Theory with Records (TTR). We show that the model’s output exactly matches the gold candidate in 78% of cases with a ROUGE-l score of 0.86. We further do a zero-shot evaluation of the ability of the same model to generate self-repairs when the generation goal changes mid-utterance. Automatic evaluation shows that the model can generate self-repairs correctly in 85% of cases. A small human evaluation confirms the naturalness and grammaticality of the generated self-repairs. Overall, these results further highlight the generalisation power of grammar-based models and lay the foundations for more controllable, and naturally interactive conversational AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various NLP tasks. However, previous works have shown these models are sensitive towards prompt wording, and few-shot demonstrations and their order, posing challenges to fair assessment of these models. As these models become more powerful, it becomes imperative to understand and address these limitations. In this paper, we focus on LLMs robustness on the task of multiple-choice questions – commonly adopted task to study reasoning and fact-retrieving capability of LLMs. Investigating the sensitivity of LLMs towards the order of options in multiple-choice questions, we demonstrate a considerable performance gap of approximately 13% to 75% in LLMs on different benchmarks, when answer options are reordered, even when using demonstrations in a few-shot setting. Through a detailed analysis, we conjecture that this sensitivity arises when LLMs are uncertain about the prediction between the top-2&#x2F;3 choices, and specific options placements may favor certain prediction between those top choices depending on the question caused by positional bias. We also identify patterns in top-2 choices that amplify or mitigate the model’s bias toward option placement. We found that for amplifying bias, the optimal strategy involves positioning the top two choices as the first and last options. Conversely, to mitigate bias, we recommend placing these choices among the adjacent options. To validate our conjecture, we conduct various experiments and adopt two approaches to calibrate LLMs’ predictions, leading to up to 8 percentage points improvement across different models and benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We introduce SONAR, a new multilingual and multimodal fixed-size sentence embedding space. Our single text encoder, covering 200 languages, substantially outperforms existing sentence embeddings such as LASER3 and LabSE on the xsim and xsim++ multilingual similarity search tasks. Speech segments can be embedded in the same SONAR embedding space using language-specific speech encoders trained in a teacher-student setting on speech transcription data. Our encoders outperform existing speech encoders on similarity search tasks. We also provide a text decoder for 200 languages, which allows us to perform text-to-text and speech-to-text machine translation, including for zero-shot language and modality combinations. Our text-to-text results are competitive compared to the state-of-the-art NLLB~1B model, despite the fixed-size bottleneck representation. Our zero-shot speech-to-text translation results compare favorably with strong supervised baselines such as Whisper.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Aspect-based sentiment classification is a crucial problem in fine-grained sentiment analysis, which aims to predict the sentiment polarity of the given aspect according to its context. Previous works have made remarkable progress in leveraging attention mechanism to extract opinion words for different aspects. However, a persistent challenge is the effective management of semantic mismatches, which stem from attention mechanisms that fall short in adequately aligning opinions words with their corresponding aspect in multi-aspect sentences. To address this issue, we propose a novel Aspect-oriented Opinion Alignment Network (AOAN) to capture the contextual association between opinion words and the corresponding aspect. Specifically, we first introduce a neighboring span enhanced module which highlights various compositions of neighboring words and given aspects. In addition, we design a multi-perspective attention mechanism that align relevant opinion information with respect to the given aspect. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results.

<p>Abstract:<br>A person’s gender is a crucial piece of information when performing research across a wide range of scientific disciplines, such as medicine, sociology, political science, and economics, to name a few. However, in increasing instances, especially given the proliferation of big data, gender information is not readily available. In such cases researchers need to infer gender from readily available information, primarily from persons’ names. While inferring gender from name may raise some ethical questions, the lack of viable alternatives means that researchers have to resort to such approaches when the goal justifies the means - in the majority of such studies the goal is to examine patterns and determinants of gender disparities. The necessity of name-to-gender inference has generated an ever-growing domain of algorithmic approaches and software products. These approaches have been used throughout the world in academia, industry, governmental and non-governmental organizations. Nevertheless, the existing approaches have yet to be systematically evaluated and compared, making it challenging to determine the optimal approach for future research. In this work, we conducted a large scale performance evaluation of existing approaches for name-to-gender inference. Analysis are performed using a variety of large annotated datasets of names. We further propose two new hybrid approaches that achieve better performance than any single existing approach.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Autonomous agents have long been a prominent research topic in the academic community. Previous research in this field often focuses on training agents with limited knowledge within isolated environments, which diverges significantly from the human learning processes, and thus makes the agents hard to achieve human-like decisions. Recently, through the acquisition of vast amounts of web knowledge, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in achieving human-level intelligence. This has sparked an upsurge in studies investigating autonomous agents based on LLMs. To harness the full potential of LLMs, researchers have devised diverse agent architectures tailored to different applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these studies, delivering a systematic review of the field of autonomous agents from a holistic perspective. More specifically, our focus lies in the construction of LLM-based agents, for which we propose a unified framework that encompasses a majority of the previous work. Additionally, we provide a summary of the various applications of LLM-based AI agents in the domains of social science, natural science, and engineering. Lastly, we discuss the commonly employed evaluation strategies for LLM-based AI agents. Based on the previous studies, we also present several challenges and future directions in this field.

<p>Abstract:<br>Extracting relational triples (subject, predicate, object) from text enables the transformation of unstructured text data into structured knowledge. The named entity recognition (NER) and the relation extraction (RE) are two foundational subtasks in this knowledge generation pipeline. The integration of subtasks poses a considerable challenge due to their disparate nature. This paper presents a novel approach that converts the triple extraction task into a graph labeling problem, capitalizing on the structural information of dependency parsing and graph recursive neural networks (GRNNs). To integrate subtasks, this paper proposes a dynamic feedback forest algorithm that connects the representations of subtasks by inference operations during model training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper presents an end-to-end model designed to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) for a particular speaker in a crowded, noisy environment. The model utilizes a single-channel speech enhancement module that isolates the speaker’s voice from background noise, along with an ASR module. Through this approach, the model is able to decrease the word error rate (WER) of ASR from 80% to 26.4%. Typically, these two components are adjusted independently due to variations in data requirements. However, speech enhancement can create anomalies that decrease ASR efficiency. By implementing a joint fine-tuning strategy, the model can reduce the WER from 26.4% in separate tuning to 14.5% in joint tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Given the long textual product information and the product image, Multi-Modal Product Summarization (MMPS) aims to attract customers’ interest and increase their desire to purchase by highlighting product characteristics with a short textual summary. Existing MMPS methods have achieved promising performance. Nevertheless, there still exist several problems: 1) lack end-to-end product summarization, 2) lack multi-grained multi-modal modeling, and 3) lack multi-modal attribute modeling. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end multi-grained multi-modal attribute-aware product summarization method (M3PS) for generating high-quality product summaries in e-commerce. M3PS jointly models product attributes and generates product summaries. Meanwhile, we design several multi-grained multi-modal tasks to better guide the multi-modal learning of M3PS. Furthermore, we model product attributes based on both text and image modalities so that multi-modal product characteristics can be manifested in the generated summaries. Extensive experiments on a real large-scale Chinese e-commence dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art product summarization methods w.r.t. several summarization metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The widespread adoption of DNNs in NLP software has highlighted the need for robustness. Researchers proposed various automatic testing techniques for adversarial test cases. However, existing methods suffer from two limitations: weak error-discovering capabilities, with success rates ranging from 0% to 24.6% for BERT-based NLP software, and time inefficiency, taking 177.8s to 205.28s per test case, making them challenging for time-constrained scenarios. To address these issues, this paper proposes LEAP, an automated test method that uses LEvy flight-based Adaptive Particle swarm optimization integrated with textual features to generate adversarial test cases. Specifically, we adopt Levy flight for population initialization to increase the diversity of generated test cases. We also design an inertial weight adaptive update operator to improve the efficiency of LEAP’s global optimization of high-dimensional text examples and a mutation operator based on the greedy strategy to reduce the search time. We conducted a series of experiments to validate LEAP’s ability to test NLP software and found that the average success rate of LEAP in generating adversarial test cases is 79.1%, which is 6.1% higher than the next best approach (PSOattack). While ensuring high success rates, LEAP significantly reduces time overhead by up to 147.6s compared to other heuristic-based methods. Additionally, the experimental results demonstrate that LEAP can generate more transferable test cases and significantly enhance the robustness of DNN-based systems.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Text-to-music generation (T2M-Gen) faces a major obstacle due to the scarcity of large-scale publicly available music datasets with natural language captions. To address this, we propose the Music Understanding LLaMA (MU-LLaMA), capable of answering music-related questions and generating captions for music files. Our model utilizes audio representations from a pretrained MERT model to extract music features. However, obtaining a suitable dataset for training the MU-LLaMA model remains challenging, as existing publicly accessible audio question answering datasets lack the necessary depth for open-ended music question answering. To fill this gap, we present a methodology for generating question-answer pairs from existing audio captioning datasets and introduce the MusicQA Dataset designed for answering open-ended music-related questions. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed MU-LLaMA model, trained on our designed MusicQA dataset, achieves outstanding performance in both music question answering and music caption generation across various metrics, outperforming current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in both fields and offering a promising advancement in the T2M-Gen research field.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The semantic parsing-based method is an important research branch for knowledge-based question answering. It usually generates executable programs lean upon the question and then conduct them to reason answers over a knowledge base. Benefit from this inherent mechanism, it has advantages in the performance and the interpretability. However,traditional semantic parsing methods usually generate a complete program before executing it, which struggles with multi-hop question answering over heterogeneous knowledge. Firstly,a complete multi-hop program relies on multiple heterogeneous supporting facts, and it is difficult for models to receive these facts simultaneously. Secondly,these methods ignore the interaction information between the previous-hop execution result and the current-hop program generation. To alleviate these challenges, we propose a self-iterative framework for multi-hop program generation (HopPG) over heterogeneous knowledge, which leverages the previous-hop execution results to retrieve supporting facts and generate subsequent programs iteratively. We evaluate our model on MMQA-T^2. The experimental results show that HopPG outperforms existing semantic-parsing-based baselines, especially on the multi-hop questions.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered considerable interest within both academic and industrial. Yet, the application of LLMs to graph data remains under-explored. In this study, we evaluate the capabilities of four LLMs in addressing several analytical problems with graph data. We employ four distinct evaluation metrics: Comprehension, Correctness, Fidelity, and Rectification. Our results show that: 1) LLMs effectively comprehend graph data in natural language and reason with graph topology. 2) GPT models can generate logical and coherent results, outperforming alternatives in correctness. 3) All examined LLMs face challenges in structural reasoning, with techniques like zero-shot chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting showing diminished efficacy. 4) GPT models often produce erroneous answers in multi-answer tasks, raising concerns in fidelity. 5) GPT models exhibit elevated confidence in their outputs, potentially hindering their rectification capacities. Notably, GPT-4 has demonstrated the capacity to rectify responses from GPT-3.5-turbo and its own previous iterations.

<p>Abstract:<br>Error prediction in large language models often relies on domain-specific information. In this paper, we present measures for quantification of error in the response of a large language model based on the diversity of responses to a given prompt - hence independent of the underlying application. We describe how three such measures - based on entropy, Gini impurity, and centroid distance - can be employed. We perform a suite of experiments on multiple datasets and temperature settings to demonstrate that these measures strongly correlate with the probability of failure. Additionally, we present empirical results demonstrating how these measures can be applied to few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and error detection.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Engaging video comments play an important role in video social media, as they are the carrier of feelings, thoughts, or humor of the audience. Preliminary works have made initial exploration for video comment generation by adopting caption-style encoder-decoder models. However, comment generation presents some unique challenges distinct from caption generation, which makes these methods somewhat less effective at generating engaging comments. In contrast to the objective and descriptive nature of captions, comments tend to be inherently subjective, making it hard to quantify and evaluate the engagement of comments. Furthermore, the scarcity of truly engaging comments brings difficulty to collecting enough high-quality training examples. In this paper, we propose ViCo with three novel designs to tackle the above challenges for generating engaging Video Comments. Firstly, to quantify the engagement of comments, we utilize the number of “likes” each comment receives as a proxy of human preference after an appropriate debiasing procedure. Secondly, to automatically evaluate the engagement of comments, we train a reward model to align its judgment to the above proxy. Our user studies indicate that this reward model effectively aligns with human judgments. Lastly, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality comments, an initial generator is trained on readily available but noisy data to generate comments. Then the reward model is employed to offer feedback on the generated comments, thus optimizing the initial generator. To facilitate the research of video commenting, we collect a large video comment-dataset (ViCo-20k) with rich metadata from a popular video website. Experiments on ViCo-20k show that the comments generated by our ViCo model exhibit the best performance in terms of both quantitative and qualitative results, particularly when engagement is considered.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The automation of code review activities, a long-standing pursuit in software engineering, has been primarily addressed by numerous domain-specific pre-trained models. Despite their success, these models frequently demand extensive resources for pre-training from scratch. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) provide an intriguing alternative, given their remarkable capabilities when supplemented with domain-specific knowledge. However, their potential for automating code review tasks remains largely unexplored.   In response to this research gap, we present LLaMA-Reviewer, an innovative framework that leverages the capabilities of LLaMA, a popular LLM, in the realm of code review. Mindful of resource constraints, this framework employs parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, delivering high performance while using less than 1% of trainable parameters.   An extensive evaluation of LLaMA-Reviewer is conducted on two diverse, publicly available datasets. Notably, even with the smallest LLaMA base model consisting of 6.7B parameters and a limited number of tuning epochs, LLaMA-Reviewer equals the performance of existing code-review-focused models.   The ablation experiments provide insights into the influence of various fine-tuning process components, including input representation, instruction tuning, and different PEFT methods. To foster continuous progress in this field, the code and all PEFT-weight plugins have been made open-source.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We develop an NLP-based procedure for detecting systematic nonmeritorious consumer complaints, simply called systematic anomalies, among complaint narratives. While classification algorithms are used to detect pronounced anomalies, in the case of smaller and frequent systematic anomalies, the algorithms may falter due to a variety of reasons, including technical ones as well as natural limitations of human analysts. Therefore, as the next step after classification, we convert the complaint narratives into quantitative data, which are then analyzed using an algorithm for detecting systematic anomalies. We illustrate the entire procedure using complaint narratives from the Consumer Complaint Database of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Anonymity of both natural and legal persons in court rulings is a critical aspect of privacy protection in the European Union and Switzerland. With the advent of LLMs, concerns about large-scale re-identification of anonymized persons are growing. In accordance with the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland, we explore the potential of LLMs to re-identify individuals in court rulings by constructing a proof-of-concept using actual legal data from the Swiss federal supreme court. Following the initial experiment, we constructed an anonymized Wikipedia dataset as a more rigorous testing ground to further investigate the findings. With the introduction and application of the new task of re-identifying people in texts, we also introduce new metrics to measure performance. We systematically analyze the factors that influence successful re-identifications, identifying model size, input length, and instruction tuning among the most critical determinants. Despite high re-identification rates on Wikipedia, even the best LLMs struggled with court decisions. The complexity is attributed to the lack of test datasets, the necessity for substantial training resources, and data sparsity in the information used for re-identification. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that re-identification using LLMs may not be feasible for now, but as the proof-of-concept on Wikipedia showed, it might become possible in the future. We hope that our system can help enhance the confidence in the security of anonymized decisions, thus leading to the courts being more confident to publish decisions.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper tackles the challenging task of evaluating socially situated conversational robots and presents a novel objective evaluation approach that relies on multimodal user behaviors. In this study, our main focus is on assessing the human-likeness of the robot as the primary evaluation metric. While previous research often relied on subjective evaluations from users, our approach aims to evaluate the robot’s human-likeness based on observable user behaviors indirectly, thus enhancing objectivity and reproducibility. To begin, we created an annotated dataset of human-likeness scores, utilizing user behaviors found in an attentive listening dialogue corpus. We then conducted an analysis to determine the correlation between multimodal user behaviors and human-likeness scores, demonstrating the feasibility of our proposed behavior-based evaluation method.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We propose a new way to assess certain short constructed responses to mathematics items. Our approach uses a pipeline that identifies the key values specified by the student in their response. This allows us to determine the correctness of the response, as well as identify any misconceptions. The information from the value identification pipeline can then be used to provide feedback to the teacher and student. The value identification pipeline consists of two fine-tuned language models. The first model determines if a value is implicit in the student response. The second model identifies where in the response the key value is specified. We consider both a generic model that can be used for any prompt and value, as well as models that are specific to each prompt and value. The value identification pipeline is a more accurate and informative way to assess short constructed responses than traditional rubric-based scoring. It can be used to provide more targeted feedback to students, which can help them improve their understanding of mathematics.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Modern large language models (LLMs) that rely on attention mechanisms are typically trained with fixed context lengths which enforce upper limits on the length of input sequences that they can handle at evaluation time. To use these models on sequences longer than the train-time context length, one might employ techniques from the growing family of context length extrapolation methods – most of which focus on modifying the system of positional encodings used in the attention mechanism to indicate where tokens or activations are located in the input sequence. We conduct a wide survey of existing methods of context length extrapolation on a base LLaMA or LLaMA 2 model, and introduce some of our own design as well – in particular, a new truncation strategy for modifying the basis for the position encoding.   We test these methods using three new evaluation tasks (FreeFormQA, AlteredNumericQA, and LongChat-Lines) as well as perplexity, which we find to be less fine-grained as a measure of long context performance of LLMs. We release the three tasks publicly as datasets on HuggingFace. We discover that linear scaling is the best method for extending context length, and show that further gains can be achieved by using longer scales at evaluation time. We also discover promising extrapolation capabilities in the truncated basis. To support further research in this area, we release three new 13B parameter long-context models which we call Giraffe: 4k and 16k context models trained from base LLaMA-13B, and a 32k context model trained from base LLaMA2-13B. We also release the code to replicate our results.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Transformer language models exhibit intelligent behaviors such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, acquiring knowledge, reasoning, planning, reflecting and using tools. This paper explores how their underlying mechanics give rise to intelligent behaviors. We adopt a systems approach to analyze Transformers in detail and develop a mathematical framework that frames their dynamics as movement through embedding space. This novel perspective provides a principled way of thinking about the problem and reveals important insights related to the emergence of intelligence:   1. At its core the Transformer is a Embedding Space walker, mapping intelligent behavior to trajectories in this vector space.   2. At each step of the walk, it composes context into a single composite vector whose location in Embedding Space defines the next step.   3. No learning actually occurs during decoding; in-context learning and generalization are simply the result of different contexts composing into different vectors.   4. Ultimately the knowledge, intelligence and skills exhibited by the model are embodied in the organization of vectors in Embedding Space rather than in specific neurons or layers. These abilities are properties of this organization.   5. Attention’s contribution boils down to the association-bias it lends to vector composition and which influences the aforementioned organization. However, more investigation is needed to ascertain its significance.   6. The entire model is composed from two principal operations: data independent filtering and data dependent aggregation. This generalization unifies Transformers with other sequence models and across modalities.   Building upon this foundation we formalize and test a semantic space theory which posits that embedding vectors represent semantic concepts and find some evidence of its validity.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>With the continuous evolution and refinement of LLMs, they are endowed with impressive logical reasoning or vertical thinking capabilities. But can they think out of the box? Do they possess proficient lateral thinking abilities? Following the setup of Lateral Thinking Puzzles, we propose a novel evaluation benchmark, LatEval, which assesses the model’s lateral thinking within an interactive framework. In our benchmark, we challenge LLMs with 2 aspects: the quality of questions posed by the model and the model’s capability to integrate information for problem-solving. We find that nearly all LLMs struggle with employing lateral thinking during interactions. For example, even the most advanced model, GPT-4, exhibits the advantage to some extent, yet still maintain a noticeable gap when compared to human. This evaluation benchmark provides LLMs with a highly challenging and distinctive task that is crucial to an effective AI assistant.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Autonomous agents empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone significant improvements, enabling them to generalize across a broad spectrum of tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, cooperation among individuals is often required to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of task accomplishment. Hence, inspired by human group dynamics, we propose a multi-agent framework \framework that can collaboratively and dynamically adjust its composition as a greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts system. Our experiments demonstrate that \framework framework can effectively deploy multi-agent groups that outperform a single agent. Furthermore, we delve into the emergence of social behaviors among individual agents within a group during collaborative task accomplishment. In view of these behaviors, we discuss some possible strategies to leverage positive ones and mitigate negative ones for improving the collaborative potential of multi-agent groups. Our codes for \framework will soon be released at \url{<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/OpenBMB/AgentVerse%7D">https://github.com/OpenBMB/AgentVerse}</a>.</p>
