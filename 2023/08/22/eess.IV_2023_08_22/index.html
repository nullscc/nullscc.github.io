<p>Abstract:<br>The aim of this work is to perform a multitemporal analysis using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for the detection of changes in urban areas using optical data and specific machine learning (ML) algorithms. As a case study, Cairo City has been identified, in Egypt country, as one of the five most populous megacities of the last decade in the world. Classification and change detection analysis of the region of interest (ROI) have been carried out from July 2013 to July 2021. Results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method in identifying changed and unchanged urban areas over the selected period. Furthermore, this work aims to evidence the growing significance of GEE as an efficient cloud-based solution for managing large quantities of satellite data.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Learning meaningful representations is at the heart of many tasks in the field of modern machine learning. Recently, a lot of methods were introduced that allow learning of image representations without supervision. These representations can then be used in downstream tasks like classification or object detection. The quality of these representations is close to supervised learning, while no labeled images are needed. This survey paper provides a comprehensive review of these methods in a unified notation, points out similarities and differences of these methods, and proposes a taxonomy which sets these methods in relation to each other. Furthermore, our survey summarizes the most-recent experimental results reported in the literature in form of a meta-study. Our survey is intended as a starting point for researchers and practitioners who want to dive into the field of representation learning.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We address the problem of learning Deep Learning Radiomics (DLR) that are not redundant with Hand-Crafted Radiomics (HCR). To do so, we extract DLR features using a VAE while enforcing their independence with HCR features by minimizing their mutual information. The resulting DLR features can be combined with hand-crafted ones and leveraged by a classifier to predict early markers of cancer. We illustrate our method on four early markers of pancreatic cancer and validate it on a large independent test set. Our results highlight the value of combining non-redundant DLR and HCR features, as evidenced by an improvement in the Area Under the Curve compared to baseline methods that do not address redundancy or solely rely on HCR features.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In this study, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical data are both considered for Earth surface classification. Specifically, the integration of Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data is carried out through supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms implemented on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for the classification of a particular region of interest. Achieved results demonstrate how in this case radar and optical remote detection provide complementary information, benefiting surface cover classification and generally leading to increased mapping accuracy. In addition, this paper works in the direction of proving the emerging role of GEE as an effective cloud-based tool for handling large amounts of satellite data.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>T1 mapping is a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) technique that has emerged as a valuable tool in the diagnosis of diffuse myocardial diseases. However, prevailing approaches have relied heavily on breath-hold sequences to eliminate respiratory motion artifacts. This limitation hinders accessibility and effectiveness for patients who cannot tolerate breath-holding. Image registration can be used to enable free-breathing T1 mapping. Yet, inherent intensity differences between the different time points make the registration task challenging. We introduce PCMC-T1, a physically-constrained deep-learning model for motion correction in free-breathing T1 mapping. We incorporate the signal decay model into the network architecture to encourage physically-plausible deformations along the longitudinal relaxation axis. We compared PCMC-T1 to baseline deep-learning-based image registration approaches using a 5-fold experimental setup on a publicly available dataset of 210 patients. PCMC-T1 demonstrated superior model fitting quality (R2: 0.955) and achieved the highest clinical impact (clinical score: 3.93) compared to baseline methods (0.941, 0.946 and 3.34, 3.62 respectively). Anatomical alignment results were comparable (Dice score: 0.9835 vs. 0.984, 0.988).

<p>Abstract:<br>Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. They include a group of malignant neoplasms with a variety of biological, clinical, and histopathological characteristics. There are more than 35 different histological forms of breast lesions that can be classified and diagnosed histologically according to cell morphology, growth, and architecture patterns. Recently, deep learning, in the field of artificial intelligence, has drawn a lot of attention for the computerized representation of medical images. Searchable digital atlases can provide pathologists with patch matching tools allowing them to search among evidently diagnosed and treated archival cases, a technology that may be regarded as computational second opinion. In this study, we indexed and analyzed the WHO breast taxonomy (Classification of Tumours 5th Ed.) spanning 35 tumour types. We visualized all tumour types using deep features extracted from a state-of-the-art deep learning model, pre-trained on millions of diagnostic histopathology images from the TCGA repository. Furthermore, we test the concept of a digital “atlas” as a reference for search and matching with rare test cases. The patch similarity search within the WHO breast taxonomy data reached over 88% accuracy when validating through “majority vote” and more than 91% accuracy when validating using top-n tumour types. These results show for the first time that complex relationships among common and rare breast lesions can be investigated using an indexed digital archive.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>One of the primary sources of suboptimal image quality in ultrasound imaging is phase aberration. It is caused by spatial changes in sound speed over a heterogeneous medium, which disturbs the transmitted waves and prevents coherent summation of echo signals. Obtaining non-aberrated ground truths in real-world scenarios can be extremely challenging, if not impossible. This challenge hinders training of deep learning-based techniques’ performance due to the presence of domain shift between simulated and experimental data. Here, for the first time, we propose a deep learning-based method that does not require ground truth to correct the phase aberration problem, and as such, can be directly trained on real data. We train a network wherein both the input and target output are randomly aberrated radio frequency (RF) data. Moreover, we demonstrate that a conventional loss function such as mean square error is inadequate for training such a network to achieve optimal performance. Instead, we propose an adaptive mixed loss function that employs both B-mode and RF data, resulting in more efficient convergence and enhanced performance. Finally, we publicly release our dataset, including 161,701 single plane-wave images (RF data). This dataset serves to mitigate the data scarcity problem in the development of deep learning-based techniques for phase aberration correction.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Generative models have seen an explosion in popularity with the release of huge generative Diffusion models like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion to the public. Because of this new ease of access, questions surrounding the automated collection of data and issues regarding content ownership have started to build. In this paper we present new work which aims to provide ways of protecting content when shared to the public. We show that a generative Diffusion model trained on data that has been imperceptibly watermarked will generate new images with these watermarks present. We further show that if a given watermark is correlated with a certain feature of the training data, the generated images will also have this correlation. Using statistical tests we show that we are able to determine whether a model has been trained on marked data, and what data was marked. As a result our system offers a solution to protect intellectual property when sharing content online.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>For machine learning-based prognosis and diagnosis of rare diseases, such as pediatric brain tumors, it is necessary to gather medical imaging data from multiple clinical sites that may use different devices and protocols. Deep learning-driven harmonization of radiologic images relies on generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs notoriously generate pseudo structures that do not exist in the original training data, a phenomenon known as “hallucination”. To prevent hallucination in medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain, we propose a one-shot learning method where we utilize neural style transfer for harmonization. At test time, the method uses one image from a clinical site to generate an image that matches the intensity scale of the collaborating sites. Our approach combines learning a feature extractor, neural style transfer, and adaptive instance normalization. We further propose a novel strategy to evaluate the effectiveness of image harmonization approaches with evaluation metrics that both measure image style harmonization and assess the preservation of anatomical structures. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in preserving patient anatomy while adjusting the image intensities to a new clinical site. Our general harmonization model can be used on unseen data from new sites, making it a valuable tool for real-world medical applications and clinical trials.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Functional tissue Units (FTUs) are cell population neighborhoods local to a particular organ performing its main function. The FTUs provide crucial information to the pathologist in understanding the disease affecting a particular organ by providing information at the cellular level. In our research, we have developed a model to segment multi-organ FTUs across 5 organs namely: the kidney, large intestine, lung, prostate and spleen by utilizing the HuBMAP + HPA - Hacking the Human Body competition dataset. We propose adding shifted auxiliary loss for training models like the transformers to overcome the diminishing gradient problem which poses a challenge towards optimal training of deep models. Overall, our model achieved a dice score of 0.793 on the public dataset and 0.778 on the private dataset and shows a 1% improvement with the use of the proposed method. The findings also bolster the use of transformers models for dense prediction tasks in the field of medical image analysis. The study assists in understanding the relationships between cell and tissue organization thereby providing a useful medium to look at the impact of cellular functions on human health.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Deep learning models can perform well in complex medical imaging classification tasks, even when basing their conclusions on spurious correlations (i.e. confounders), should they be prevalent in the training dataset, rather than on the causal image markers of interest. This would thereby limit their ability to generalize across the population. Explainability based on counterfactual image generation can be used to expose the confounders but does not provide a strategy to mitigate the bias. In this work, we introduce the first end-to-end training framework that integrates both (i) popular debiasing classifiers (e.g. distributionally robust optimization (DRO)) to avoid latching onto the spurious correlations and (ii) counterfactual image generation to unveil generalizable imaging markers of relevance to the task. Additionally, we propose a novel metric, Spurious Correlation Latching Score (SCLS), to quantify the extent of the classifier reliance on the spurious correlation as exposed by the counterfactual images. Through comprehensive experiments on two public datasets (with the simulated and real visual artifacts), we demonstrate that the debiasing method: (i) learns generalizable markers across the population, and (ii) successfully ignores spurious correlations and focuses on the underlying disease pathology.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This work presents BundleSeg, a reliable, reproducible, and fast method for extracting white matter pathways. The proposed method combines an iterative registration procedure with a recently developed precise streamline search algorithm that enables efficient segmentation of streamlines without the need for tractogram clustering or simplifying assumptions. We show that BundleSeg achieves improved repeatability and reproducibility than state-of-the-art segmentation methods, with significant speed improvements. The enhanced precision and reduced variability in extracting white matter connections offer a valuable tool for neuroinformatic studies, increasing the sensitivity and specificity of tractography-based studies of white matter pathways.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Hyperspectral Image (HSI) reconstruction has made gratifying progress with the deep unfolding framework by formulating the problem into a data module and a prior module. Nevertheless, existing methods still face the problem of insufficient matching with HSI data. The issues lie in three aspects: 1) fixed gradient descent step in the data module while the degradation of HSI is agnostic in the pixel-level. 2) inadequate prior module for 3D HSI cube. 3) stage interaction ignoring the differences in features at different stages. To address these issues, in this work, we propose a Pixel Adaptive Deep Unfolding Transformer (PADUT) for HSI reconstruction. In the data module, a pixel adaptive descent step is employed to focus on pixel-level agnostic degradation. In the prior module, we introduce the Non-local Spectral Transformer (NST) to emphasize the 3D characteristics of HSI for recovering. Moreover, inspired by the diverse expression of features in different stages and depths, the stage interaction is improved by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Experimental results on both simulated and real scenes exhibit the superior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art HSI reconstruction methods.
