<p>Abstract:<br>The field of multi-object tracking has recently seen a renewed interest in the good old schema of tracking-by-detection, as its simplicity and strong priors spare it from the complex design and painful babysitting of tracking-by-attention approaches. In view of this, we aim at extending tracking-by-detection to multi-modal settings, where a comprehensive cost has to be computed from heterogeneous information e.g., 2D motion cues, visual appearance, and pose estimates. More precisely, we follow a case study where a rough estimate of 3D information is also available and must be merged with other traditional metrics (e.g., the IoU). To achieve that, recent approaches resort to either simple rules or complex heuristics to balance the contribution of each cost. However, i) they require careful tuning of tailored hyperparameters on a hold-out set, and ii) they imply these costs to be independent, which does not hold in reality. We address these issues by building upon an elegant probabilistic formulation, which considers the cost of a candidate association as the negative log-likelihood yielded by a deep density estimator, trained to model the conditional joint probability distribution of correct associations. Our experiments, conducted on both simulated and real benchmarks, show that our approach consistently enhances the performance of several tracking-by-detection algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In recent years, vision transformers have been introduced into face recognition and analysis and have achieved performance breakthroughs. However, most previous methods generally train a single model or an ensemble of models to perform the desired task, which ignores the synergy among different tasks and fails to achieve improved prediction accuracy, increased data efficiency, and reduced training time. This paper presents a multi-purpose algorithm for simultaneous face recognition, facial expression recognition, age estimation, and face attribute estimation (40 attributes including gender) based on a single Swin Transformer. Our design, the SwinFace, consists of a single shared backbone together with a subnet for each set of related tasks. To address the conflicts among multiple tasks and meet the different demands of tasks, a Multi-Level Channel Attention (MLCA) module is integrated into each task-specific analysis subnet, which can adaptively select the features from optimal levels and channels to perform the desired tasks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model has a better understanding of the face and achieves excellent performance for all tasks. Especially, it achieves 90.97% accuracy on RAF-DB and 0.22 $\epsilon$-error on CLAP2015, which are state-of-the-art results on facial expression recognition and age estimation respectively. The code and models will be made publicly available at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/lxq1000/SwinFace">https://github.com/lxq1000/SwinFace</a>.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recently, large-scale pre-trained vision-language models (e.g. CLIP and ALIGN) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in acquiring transferable visual representations. To leverage the valuable knowledge encoded within these models for downstream tasks, several fine-tuning approaches, including prompt tuning methods and adapter-based methods, have been developed to adapt vision-language models effectively with supervision. However, these methods rely on the availability of annotated samples, which can be labor-intensive and time-consuming to acquire, thus limiting scalability. To address this issue, in this work, we design an unsupervised fine-tuning approach for vision-language models called Unsupervised Prototype Adapter (UP-Adapter). Specifically, for the unannotated target datasets, we leverage the text-image aligning capability of CLIP to automatically select the most confident samples for each class. Utilizing these selected samples, we generate class prototypes, which serve as the initialization for the learnable prototype model. After fine-tuning, the prototype model prediction is combined with the original CLIP’s prediction by a residual connection to perform downstream recognition tasks. Our extensive experimental results on image recognition and domain generalization show that the proposed unsupervised method outperforms 8-shot CoOp, 8-shot Tip-Adapter, and also the state-of-the-art UPL method by large margins.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper studies co-segmenting the common semantic object in a set of images. Existing works either rely on carefully engineered networks to mine the implicit semantic information in visual features or require extra data (i.e., classification labels) for training. In this paper, we leverage the contrastive language-image pre-training framework (CLIP) for the task. With a backbone segmentation network that independently processes each image from the set, we introduce semantics from CLIP into the backbone features, refining them in a coarse-to-fine manner with three key modules: i) an image set feature correspondence module, encoding global consistent semantic information of the image set; ii) a CLIP interaction module, using CLIP-mined common semantics of the image set to refine the backbone feature; iii) a CLIP regularization module, drawing CLIP towards this co-segmentation task, identifying the best CLIP semantic and using it to regularize the backbone feature. Experiments on four standard co-segmentation benchmark datasets show that the performance of our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We are concerned with a challenging scenario in unpaired multiview video learning. In this case, the model aims to learn comprehensive multiview representations while the cross-view semantic information exhibits variations. We propose Semantics-based Unpaired Multiview Learning (SUM-L) to tackle this unpaired multiview learning problem. The key idea is to build cross-view pseudo-pairs and do view-invariant alignment by leveraging the semantic information of videos. To facilitate the data efficiency of multiview learning, we further perform video-text alignment for first-person and third-person videos, to fully leverage the semantic knowledge to improve video representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our framework. Our method also outperforms multiple existing view-alignment methods, under the more challenging scenario than typical paired or unpaired multimodal or multiview learning.

<p>Abstract:<br>Human actions in egocentric videos are often hand-object interactions composed from a verb (performed by the hand) applied to an object. Despite their extensive scaling up, egocentric datasets still face two limitations - sparsity of action compositions and a closed set of interacting objects. This paper proposes a novel open vocabulary action recognition task. Given a set of verbs and objects observed during training, the goal is to generalize the verbs to an open vocabulary of actions with seen and novel objects. To this end, we decouple the verb and object predictions via an object-agnostic verb encoder and a prompt-based object encoder. The prompting leverages CLIP representations to predict an open vocabulary of interacting objects. We create open vocabulary benchmarks on the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 and Assembly101 datasets; whereas closed-action methods fail to generalize, our proposed method is effective. In addition, our object encoder significantly outperforms existing open-vocabulary visual recognition methods in recognizing novel interacting objects.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Gait recognition is to seek correct matches for query individuals by their unique walking patterns at a long distance. However, current methods focus solely on individual gait features, disregarding inter-personal relationships. In this paper, we reconsider gait representation, asserting that gait is not just an aggregation of individual features, but also the relationships among different subjects’ gait features once reference gaits are established. From this perspective, we redefine classifier weights as reference-anchored gaits, allowing each person’s gait to be described by their relationship with these references. In our work, we call this novel descriptor Relationship Descriptor (RD). This Relationship Descriptor offers two benefits: emphasizing meaningful features and enhancing robustness. To be specific, The normalized dot product between gait features and classifier weights signifies a similarity relation, where each dimension indicates the similarity between the test sample and each training ID’s gait prototype, respectively. Despite its potential, the direct use of relationship descriptors poses dimensionality challenges since the dimension of RD depends on the training set’s identity count. To address this, we propose a Farthest Anchored gaits Selection algorithm and a dimension reduction method to boost gait recognition performance. Our method can be built on top of off-the-shelf pre-trained classification-based models without extra parameters. We show that RD achieves higher recognition performance than directly using extracted features. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on the popular GREW, Gait3D, CASIA-B, and OU-MVLP, showing that our method consistently outperforms the baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performances.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Given a query composed of a reference image and a relative caption, the Composed Image Retrieval goal is to retrieve images visually similar to the reference one that integrates the modifications expressed by the caption. Given that recent research has demonstrated the efficacy of large-scale vision and language pre-trained (VLP) models in various tasks, we rely on features from the OpenAI CLIP model to tackle the considered task. We initially perform a task-oriented fine-tuning of both CLIP encoders using the element-wise sum of visual and textual features. Then, in the second stage, we train a Combiner network that learns to combine the image-text features integrating the bimodal information and providing combined features used to perform the retrieval. We use contrastive learning in both stages of training. Starting from the bare CLIP features as a baseline, experimental results show that the task-oriented fine-tuning and the carefully crafted Combiner network are highly effective and outperform more complex state-of-the-art approaches on FashionIQ and CIRR, two popular and challenging datasets for composed image retrieval.

<p>Abstract:<br>Video-based ambient monitoring of gait for older adults with dementia has the potential to detect negative changes in health and allow clinicians and caregivers to intervene early to prevent falls or hospitalizations. Computer vision-based pose tracking models can process video data automatically and extract joint locations; however, publicly available models are not optimized for gait analysis on older adults or clinical populations. In this work we train a deep neural network to map from a two dimensional pose sequence, extracted from a video of an individual walking down a hallway toward a wall-mounted camera, to a set of three-dimensional spatiotemporal gait features averaged over the walking sequence. The data of individuals with dementia used in this work was captured at two sites using a wall-mounted system to collect the video and depth information used to train and evaluate our model. Our Pose2Gait model is able to extract velocity and step length values from the video that are correlated with the features from the depth camera, with Spearman’s correlation coefficients of .83 and .60 respectively, showing that three dimensional spatiotemporal features can be predicted from monocular video. Future work remains to improve the accuracy of other features, such as step time and step width, and test the utility of the predicted values for detecting meaningful changes in gait during longitudinal ambient monitoring.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The recent contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model has shown great success in a wide range of image-level tasks, revealing remarkable ability for learning powerful visual representations with rich semantics. An open and worthwhile problem is efficiently adapting such a strong model to the video domain and designing a robust video anomaly detector. In this work, we propose VadCLIP, a new paradigm for weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD) by leveraging the frozen CLIP model directly without any pre-training and fine-tuning process. Unlike current works that directly feed extracted features into the weakly supervised classifier for frame-level binary classification, VadCLIP makes full use of fine-grained associations between vision and language on the strength of CLIP and involves dual branch. One branch simply utilizes visual features for coarse-grained binary classification, while the other fully leverages the fine-grained language-image alignment. With the benefit of dual branch, VadCLIP achieves both coarse-grained and fine-grained video anomaly detection by transferring pre-trained knowledge from CLIP to WSVAD task. We conduct extensive experiments on two commonly-used benchmarks, demonstrating that VadCLIP achieves the best performance on both coarse-grained and fine-grained WSVAD, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Specifically, VadCLIP achieves 84.51% AP and 88.02% AUC on XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, respectively. Code and features will be released to facilitate future VAD research.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Improving the reliability of deployed machine learning systems often involves developing methods to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. However, existing research often narrowly focuses on samples from classes that are absent from the training set, neglecting other types of plausible distribution shifts. This limitation reduces the applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios, where systems encounter a wide variety of anomalous inputs. In this study, we categorize five distinct types of distribution shifts and critically evaluate the performance of recent OOD detection methods on each of them. We publicly release our benchmark under the name BROAD (Benchmarking Resilience Over Anomaly Diversity). Our findings reveal that while these methods excel in detecting unknown classes, their performance is inconsistent when encountering other types of distribution shifts. In other words, they only reliably detect unexpected inputs that they have been specifically designed to expect. As a first step toward broad OOD detection, we learn a generative model of existing detection scores with a Gaussian mixture. By doing so, we present an ensemble approach that offers a more consistent and comprehensive solution for broad OOD detection, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. Our code to download BROAD and reproduce our experiments is publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recent strides in Text-to-3D techniques have been propelled by distilling knowledge from powerful large text-to-image diffusion models (LDMs). Nonetheless, existing Text-to-3D approaches often grapple with challenges such as over-saturation, inadequate detailing, and unrealistic outputs. This study presents a novel strategy that leverages explicitly synthesized multi-view images to address these issues. Our approach involves the utilization of image-to-image pipelines, empowered by LDMs, to generate posed high-quality images based on the renderings of coarse 3D models. Although the generated images mostly alleviate the aforementioned issues, challenges such as view inconsistency and significant content variance persist due to the inherent generative nature of large diffusion models, posing extensive difficulties in leveraging these images effectively. To overcome this hurdle, we advocate integrating a discriminator alongside a novel Diffusion-GAN dual training strategy to guide the training of 3D models. For the incorporated discriminator, the synthesized multi-view images are considered real data, while the renderings of the optimized 3D models function as fake data. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over baseline approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This work targets what we consider to be the foundational step for urban airborne robots, a safe landing. Our attention is directed toward what we deem the most crucial aspect of the safe landing perception stack: segmentation. We present a streamlined reactive UAV system that employs visual servoing by harnessing the capabilities of open vocabulary image segmentation. This approach can adapt to various scenarios with minimal adjustments, bypassing the necessity for extensive data accumulation for refining internal models, thanks to its open vocabulary methodology. Given the limitations imposed by local authorities, our primary focus centers on operations originating from altitudes of 100 meters. This choice is deliberate, as numerous preceding works have dealt with altitudes up to 30 meters, aligning with the capabilities of small stereo cameras. Consequently, we leave the remaining 20m to be navigated using conventional 3D path planning methods. Utilizing monocular cameras and image segmentation, our findings demonstrate the system’s capability to successfully execute landing maneuvers at altitudes as low as 20 meters. However, this approach is vulnerable to intermittent and occasionally abrupt fluctuations in the segmentation between frames in a video stream. To address this challenge, we enhance the image segmentation output by introducing what we call a dynamic focus: a masking mechanism that self adjusts according to the current landing stage. This dynamic focus guides the control system to avoid regions beyond the drone’s safety radius projected onto the ground, thus mitigating the problems with fluctuations. Through the implementation of this supplementary layer, our experiments have reached improvements in the landing success rate of almost tenfold when compared to global segmentation. All the source code is open source and available online (github.com&#x2F;MISTLab&#x2F;DOVESEI).</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The aim of this work is to perform a multitemporal analysis using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for the detection of changes in urban areas using optical data and specific machine learning (ML) algorithms. As a case study, Cairo City has been identified, in Egypt country, as one of the five most populous megacities of the last decade in the world. Classification and change detection analysis of the region of interest (ROI) have been carried out from July 2013 to July 2021. Results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method in identifying changed and unchanged urban areas over the selected period. Furthermore, this work aims to evidence the growing significance of GEE as an efficient cloud-based solution for managing large quantities of satellite data.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to build classification models from data streams. At each step of the CIL process, new classes must be integrated into the model. Due to catastrophic forgetting, CIL is particularly challenging when examples from past classes cannot be stored, the case on which we focus here. To date, most approaches are based exclusively on the target dataset of the CIL process. However, the use of models pre-trained in a self-supervised way on large amounts of data has recently gained momentum. The initial model of the CIL process may only use the first batch of the target dataset, or also use pre-trained weights obtained on an auxiliary dataset. The choice between these two initial learning strategies can significantly influence the performance of the incremental learning model, but has not yet been studied in depth. Performance is also influenced by the choice of the CIL algorithm, the neural architecture, the nature of the target task, the distribution of classes in the stream and the number of examples available for learning. We conduct a comprehensive experimental study to assess the roles of these factors. We present a statistical analysis framework that quantifies the relative contribution of each factor to incremental performance. Our main finding is that the initial training strategy is the dominant factor influencing the average incremental accuracy, but that the choice of CIL algorithm is more important in preventing forgetting. Based on this analysis, we propose practical recommendations for choosing the right initial training strategy for a given incremental learning use case. These recommendations are intended to facilitate the practical deployment of incremental learning.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The demand for accurate food quantification has increased in the recent years, driven by the needs of applications in dietary monitoring. At the same time, computer vision approaches have exhibited great potential in automating tasks within the food domain. Traditionally, the development of machine learning models for these problems relies on training data sets with pixel-level class annotations. However, this approach introduces challenges arising from data collection and ground truth generation that quickly become costly and error-prone since they must be performed in multiple settings and for thousands of classes. To overcome these challenges, the paper presents a weakly supervised methodology for training food image classification and semantic segmentation models without relying on pixel-level annotations. The proposed methodology is based on a multiple instance learning approach in combination with an attention-based mechanism. At test time, the models are used for classification and, concurrently, the attention mechanism generates semantic heat maps which are used for food class segmentation. In the paper, we conduct experiments on two meta-classes within the FoodSeg103 data set to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach and we explore the functioning properties of the attention mechanism.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Maintaining high efficiency and high precision are two fundamental challenges in UAV tracking due to the constraints of computing resources, battery capacity, and UAV maximum load. Discriminative correlation filters (DCF)-based trackers can yield high efficiency on a single CPU but with inferior precision. Lightweight Deep learning (DL)-based trackers can achieve a good balance between efficiency and precision but performance gains are limited by the compression rate. High compression rate often leads to poor discriminative representations. To this end, this paper aims to enhance the discriminative power of feature representations from a new feature-learning perspective. Specifically, we attempt to learn more disciminative representations with contrastive instances for UAV tracking in a simple yet effective manner, which not only requires no manual annotations but also allows for developing and deploying a lightweight model. We are the first to explore contrastive learning for UAV tracking. Extensive experiments on four UAV benchmarks, including UAV123@10fps, DTB70, UAVDT and VisDrone2018, show that the proposed DRCI tracker significantly outperforms state-of-the-art UAV tracking methods.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Self-supervised pretraining (SSP) has emerged as a popular technique in machine learning, enabling the extraction of meaningful feature representations without labelled data. In the realm of computer vision, pretrained vision transformers (ViTs) have played a pivotal role in advancing transfer learning. Nonetheless, the escalating cost of finetuning these large models has posed a challenge due to the explosion of model size. This study endeavours to evaluate the effectiveness of pure self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques in computer vision tasks, obviating the need for finetuning, with the intention of emulating human-like capabilities in generalisation and recognition of unseen objects. To this end, we propose an evaluation protocol for zero-shot segmentation based on a prompting patch. Given a point on the target object as a prompt, the algorithm calculates the similarity map between the selected patch and other patches, upon that, a simple thresholding is applied to segment the target. Another evaluation is intra-object and inter-object similarity to gauge discriminatory ability of SSP ViTs. Insights from zero-shot segmentation from prompting and discriminatory abilities of SSP led to the design of a simple SSP approach, termed MMC. This approaches combines Masked image modelling for encouraging similarity of local features, Momentum based self-distillation for transferring semantics from global to local features, and global Contrast for promoting semantics of global features, to enhance discriminative representations of SSP ViTs. Consequently, our proposed method significantly reduces the overlap of intra-object and inter-object similarities, thereby facilitating effective object segmentation within an image. Our experiments reveal that MMC delivers top-tier results in zero-shot semantic segmentation across various datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Fast Adversarial Training (FAT) not only improves the model robustness but also reduces the training cost of standard adversarial training. However, fast adversarial training often suffers from Catastrophic Overfitting (CO), which results in poor robustness performance. Catastrophic Overfitting describes the phenomenon of a sudden and significant decrease in robust accuracy during the training of fast adversarial training. Many effective techniques have been developed to prevent Catastrophic Overfitting and improve the model robustness from different perspectives. However, these techniques adopt inconsistent training settings and require different training costs, i.e, training time and memory costs, leading to unfair comparisons. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of over 10 fast adversarial training methods in terms of adversarial robustness and training costs. We revisit the effectiveness and efficiency of fast adversarial training techniques in preventing Catastrophic Overfitting from the perspective of model local nonlinearity and propose an effective Lipschitz regularization method for fast adversarial training. Furthermore, we explore the effect of data augmentation and weight averaging in fast adversarial training and propose a simple yet effective auto weight averaging method to improve robustness further. By assembling these techniques, we propose a FGSM-based fast adversarial training method equipped with Lipschitz regularization and Auto Weight averaging, abbreviated as FGSM-LAW. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark databases demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art fast adversarial training methods and the advanced standard adversarial training methods.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Face Recognition Systems (FRS) are vulnerable to morph attacks. A face morph is created by combining multiple identities with the intention to fool FRS and making it match the morph with multiple identities. Current Morph Attack Detection (MAD) can detect the morph but are unable to recover the identities used to create the morph with satisfactory outcomes. Existing work in de-morphing is mostly reference-based, i.e. they require the availability of one identity to recover the other. Sudipta et al. \cite{ref9} proposed a reference-free de-morphing technique but the visual realism of outputs produced were feeble. In this work, we propose SDeMorph (Stably Diffused De-morpher), a novel de-morphing method that is reference-free and recovers the identities of bona fides. Our method produces feature-rich outputs that are of significantly high quality in terms of definition and facial fidelity. Our method utilizes Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) by destroying the input morphed signal and then reconstructing it back using a branched-UNet. Experiments on ASML, FRLL-FaceMorph, FRLL-MorDIFF, and SMDD datasets support the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Latest methods represent shapes with open surfaces using unsigned distance functions (UDFs). They train neural networks to learn UDFs and reconstruct surfaces with the gradients around the zero level set of the UDF. However, the differential networks struggle from learning the zero level set where the UDF is not differentiable, which leads to large errors on unsigned distances and gradients around the zero level set, resulting in highly fragmented and discontinuous surfaces. To resolve this problem, we propose to learn a more continuous zero level set in UDFs with level set projections. Our insight is to guide the learning of zero level set using the rest non-zero level sets via a projection procedure. Our idea is inspired from the observations that the non-zero level sets are much smoother and more continuous than the zero level set. We pull the non-zero level sets onto the zero level set with gradient constraints which align gradients over different level sets and correct unsigned distance errors on the zero level set, leading to a smoother and more continuous unsigned distance field. We conduct comprehensive experiments in surface reconstruction for point clouds, real scans or depth maps, and further explore the performance in unsupervised point cloud upsampling and unsupervised point normal estimation with the learned UDF, which demonstrate our non-trivial improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Abstract:<br>Existing kinematic skeleton-based 3D human pose estimation methods only predict joint positions. Although this is sufficient to compute the yaw and pitch of the bone rotations, the roll around the axis of the bones remains unresolved by these methods. In this paper, we propose a novel 2D-to-3D lifting Graph Convolution Network named PoseGraphNet++ to predict the complete human pose including the joint positions and the bone orientations. We employ node and edge convolutions to utilize the joint and bone features. Our model is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, and its performance is either on par with or better than the state-of-the-art in terms of both position and rotation metrics. Through extensive ablation studies, we show that PoseGraphNet++ benefits from exploiting the mutual relationship between the joints and the bones.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Vision transformers have shown unprecedented levels of performance in tackling various visual perception tasks in recent years. However, the architectural and computational complexity of such network architectures have made them challenging to deploy in real-world applications with high-throughput, low-memory requirements. As such, there has been significant research recently on the design of efficient vision transformer architectures. In this study, we explore the generation of fast vision transformer architecture designs via generative architecture search (GAS) to achieve a strong balance between accuracy and architectural and computational efficiency. Through this generative architecture search process, we create TurboViT, a highly efficient hierarchical vision transformer architecture design that is generated around mask unit attention and Q-pooling design patterns. The resulting TurboViT architecture design achieves significantly lower architectural computational complexity (&gt;2.47$\times$ smaller than FasterViT-0 while achieving same accuracy) and computational complexity (&gt;3.4$\times$ fewer FLOPs and 0.9% higher accuracy than MobileViT2-2.0) when compared to 10 other state-of-the-art efficient vision transformer network architecture designs within a similar range of accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset. Furthermore, TurboViT demonstrated strong inference latency and throughput in both low-latency and batch processing scenarios (&gt;3.21$\times$ lower latency and &gt;3.18$\times$ higher throughput compared to FasterViT-0 for low-latency scenario). These promising results demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging generative architecture search for generating efficient transformer architecture designs for high-throughput scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We present ScanNet++, a large-scale dataset that couples together capture of high-quality and commodity-level geometry and color of indoor scenes. Each scene is captured with a high-end laser scanner at sub-millimeter resolution, along with registered 33-megapixel images from a DSLR camera, and RGB-D streams from an iPhone. Scene reconstructions are further annotated with an open vocabulary of semantics, with label-ambiguous scenarios explicitly annotated for comprehensive semantic understanding. ScanNet++ enables a new real-world benchmark for novel view synthesis, both from high-quality RGB capture, and importantly also from commodity-level images, in addition to a new benchmark for 3D semantic scene understanding that comprehensively encapsulates diverse and ambiguous semantic labeling scenarios. Currently, ScanNet++ contains 460 scenes, 280,000 captured DSLR images, and over 3.7M iPhone RGBD frames.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Creating high quality and realistic materials in computer graphics is a challenging and time-consuming task, which requires great expertise. In this paper, we present MatFuse, a novel unified approach that harnesses the generative power of diffusion models (DM) to simplify the creation of SVBRDF maps. Our DM-based pipeline integrates multiple sources of conditioning, such as color palettes, sketches, and pictures, enabling fine-grained control and flexibility in material synthesis. This design allows for the combination of diverse information sources (e.g., sketch + image embedding), enhancing creative possibilities in line with the principle of compositionality. We demonstrate the generative capabilities of the proposed method under various conditioning settings; on the SVBRDF estimation task, we show that our method yields performance comparable to state-of-the-art approaches, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We address the problem of learning Deep Learning Radiomics (DLR) that are not redundant with Hand-Crafted Radiomics (HCR). To do so, we extract DLR features using a VAE while enforcing their independence with HCR features by minimizing their mutual information. The resulting DLR features can be combined with hand-crafted ones and leveraged by a classifier to predict early markers of cancer. We illustrate our method on four early markers of pancreatic cancer and validate it on a large independent test set. Our results highlight the value of combining non-redundant DLR and HCR features, as evidenced by an improvement in the Area Under the Curve compared to baseline methods that do not address redundancy or solely rely on HCR features.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The development of fair and ethical AI systems requires careful consideration of bias mitigation, an area often overlooked or ignored. In this study, we introduce a novel and efficient approach for addressing biases called Targeted Data Augmentation (TDA), which leverages classical data augmentation techniques to tackle the pressing issue of bias in data and models. Unlike the laborious task of removing biases, our method proposes to insert biases instead, resulting in improved performance. To identify biases, we annotated two diverse datasets: a dataset of clinical skin lesions and a dataset of male and female faces. These bias annotations are published for the first time in this study, providing a valuable resource for future research. Through Counterfactual Bias Insertion, we discovered that biases associated with the frame, ruler, and glasses had a significant impact on models. By randomly introducing biases during training, we mitigated these biases and achieved a substantial decrease in bias measures, ranging from two-fold to more than 50-fold, while maintaining a negligible increase in the error rate.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Rail detection is one of the key factors for intelligent train. In the paper, motivated by the anchor line-based lane detection methods, we propose a rail detection network called DALNet based on dynamic anchor line. Aiming to solve the problem that the predefined anchor line is image agnostic, we design a novel dynamic anchor line mechanism. It utilizes a dynamic anchor line generator to dynamically generate an appropriate anchor line for each rail instance based on the position and shape of the rails in the input image. These dynamically generated anchor lines can be considered as better position references to accurately localize the rails than the predefined anchor lines. In addition, we present a challenging urban rail detection dataset DL-Rail with high-quality annotations and scenario diversity. DL-Rail contains 7000 pairs of images and annotations along with scene tags, and it is expected to encourage the development of rail detection. We extensively compare DALNet with many competitive lane methods. The results show that our DALNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on our DL-Rail rail detection dataset and the popular Tusimple and LLAMAS lane detection benchmarks.

<p>Abstract:<br>We propose Boundary-RL, a novel weakly supervised segmentation method that utilises only patch-level labels for training. We envision the segmentation as a boundary detection problem, rather than a pixel-level classification as in previous works. This outlook on segmentation may allow for boundary delineation under challenging scenarios such as where noise artefacts may be present within the region-of-interest (ROI) boundaries, where traditional pixel-level classification-based weakly supervised methods may not be able to effectively segment the ROI. Particularly of interest, ultrasound images, where intensity values represent acoustic impedance differences between boundaries, may also benefit from the boundary delineation approach. Our method uses reinforcement learning to train a controller function to localise boundaries of ROIs using a reward derived from a pre-trained boundary-presence classifier. The classifier indicates when an object boundary is encountered within a patch, as the controller modifies the patch location in a sequential Markov decision process. The classifier itself is trained using only binary patch-level labels of object presence, which are the only labels used during training of the entire boundary delineation framework, and serves as a weak signal to inform the boundary delineation. The use of a controller function ensures that a sliding window over the entire image is not necessary. It also prevents possible false-positive or -negative cases by minimising number of patches passed to the boundary-presence classifier. We evaluate our proposed approach for a clinically relevant task of prostate gland segmentation on trans-rectal ultrasound images. We show improved performance compared to other tested weakly supervised methods, using the same labels e.g., multiple instance learning.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Object-centric representations using slots have shown the advances towards efficient, flexible and interpretable abstraction from low-level perceptual features in a compositional scene. Current approaches randomize the initial state of slots followed by an iterative refinement. As we show in this paper, the random slot initialization significantly affects the accuracy of the final slot prediction. Moreover, current approaches require a predetermined number of slots from prior knowledge of the data, which limits the applicability in the real world. In our work, we initialize the slot representations with clustering algorithms conditioned on the perceptual input features. This requires an additional layer in the architecture to initialize the slots given the identified clusters. We design permutation invariant and permutation equivariant versions of this layer to enable the exchangeable slot representations after clustering. Additionally, we employ mean-shift clustering to automatically identify the number of slots for a given scene. We evaluate our method on object discovery and novel view synthesis tasks with various datasets. The results show that our method outperforms prior works consistently, especially for complex scenes.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Super-resolution (SR) networks have been investigated for a while, with their mobile and lightweight versions gaining noticeable popularity recently. Quantization, the procedure of decreasing the precision of network parameters (mostly FP32 to INT8), is also utilized in SR networks for establishing mobile compatibility. This study focuses on a very important but mostly overlooked post-training quantization (PTQ) step: representative dataset (RD), which adjusts the quantization range for PTQ. We propose a novel pipeline (clip-free quantization pipeline, CFQP) backed up with extensive experimental justifications to cleverly augment RD images by only using outputs of the FP32 model. Using the proposed pipeline for RD, we can successfully eliminate unwanted clipped activation layers, which nearly all mobile SR methods utilize to make the model more robust to PTQ in return for a large overhead in runtime. Removing clipped activations with our method significantly benefits overall increased stability, decreased inference runtime up to 54% on some SR models, better visual quality results compared to INT8 clipped models - and outperforms even some FP32 non-quantized models, both in runtime and visual quality, without the need for retraining with clipped activation.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Modeling long-term context in videos is crucial for many fine-grained tasks including temporal action segmentation. An interesting question that is still open is how much long-term temporal context is needed for optimal performance. While transformers can model the long-term context of a video, this becomes computationally prohibitive for long videos. Recent works on temporal action segmentation thus combine temporal convolutional networks with self-attentions that are computed only for a local temporal window. While these approaches show good results, their performance is limited by their inability to capture the full context of a video. In this work, we try to answer how much long-term temporal context is required for temporal action segmentation by introducing a transformer-based model that leverages sparse attention to capture the full context of a video. We compare our model with the current state of the art on three datasets for temporal action segmentation, namely 50Salads, Breakfast, and Assembly101. Our experiments show that modeling the full context of a video is necessary to obtain the best performance for temporal action segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Continual Learning (CL) involves training a machine learning model in a sequential manner to learn new information while retaining previously learned tasks without the presence of previous training data. Although there has been significant interest in CL, most recent CL approaches in computer vision have focused on convolutional architectures only. However, with the recent success of vision transformers, there is a need to explore their potential for CL. Although there have been some recent CL approaches for vision transformers, they either store training instances of previous tasks or require a task identifier during test time, which can be limiting. This paper proposes a new exemplar-free approach for class&#x2F;task incremental learning called ConTraCon, which does not require task-id to be explicitly present during inference and avoids the need for storing previous training instances. The proposed approach leverages the transformer architecture and involves re-weighting the key, query, and value weights of the multi-head self-attention layers of a transformer trained on a similar task. The re-weighting is done using convolution, which enables the approach to maintain low parameter requirements per task. Additionally, an image augmentation-based entropic task identification approach is used to predict tasks without requiring task-ids during inference. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms several competitive approaches while requiring fewer parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Collecting diverse sets of training images for RGB-D semantic image segmentation is not always possible. In particular, when robots need to operate in privacy-sensitive areas like homes, the collection is often limited to a small set of locations. As a consequence, the annotated images lack diversity in appearance and approaches for RGB-D semantic image segmentation tend to overfit the training data. In this paper, we thus introduce semantic RGB-D image synthesis to address this problem. It requires synthesising a realistic-looking RGB-D image for a given semantic label map. Current approaches, however, are uni-modal and cannot cope with multi-modal data. Indeed, we show that extending uni-modal approaches to multi-modal data does not perform well. In this paper, we therefore propose a generator for multi-modal data that separates modal-independent information of the semantic layout from the modal-dependent information that is needed to generate an RGB and a depth image, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a discriminator that ensures semantic consistency between the label maps and the generated images and perceptual similarity between the real and generated images. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous uni-modal methods by a large margin and that the accuracy of an approach for RGB-D semantic segmentation can be significantly improved by mixing real and generated images during training.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In this study, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical data are both considered for Earth surface classification. Specifically, the integration of Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data is carried out through supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms implemented on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for the classification of a particular region of interest. Achieved results demonstrate how in this case radar and optical remote detection provide complementary information, benefiting surface cover classification and generally leading to increased mapping accuracy. In addition, this paper works in the direction of proving the emerging role of GEE as an effective cloud-based tool for handling large amounts of satellite data.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Cross-modal pre-training has shown impressive performance on a wide range of downstream tasks, benefiting from massive image-text pairs collected from the Internet. In practice, online data are growing constantly, highlighting the importance of the ability of pre-trained model to learn from data that is continuously growing. Existing works on cross-modal pre-training mainly focus on training a network with fixed architecture. However, it is impractical to limit the model capacity when considering the continuously growing nature of pre-training data in real-world applications. On the other hand, it is important to utilize the knowledge in the current model to obtain efficient training and better performance. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose GrowCLIP, a data-driven automatic model growing algorithm for contrastive language-image pre-training with continuous image-text pairs as input. Specially, we adopt a dynamic growth space and seek out the optimal architecture at each growth step to adapt to online learning scenarios. And the shared encoder is proposed in our growth space to enhance the degree of cross-modal fusion. Besides, we explore the effect of growth in different dimensions, which could provide future references for the design of cross-modal model architecture. Finally, we employ parameter inheriting with momentum (PIM) to maintain the previous knowledge and address the issue of the local minimum dilemma. Compared with the existing methods, GrowCLIP improves 2.3% average top-1 accuracy on zero-shot image classification of 9 downstream tasks. As for zero-shot image retrieval, GrowCLIP can improve 1.2% for top-1 image-to-text recall on Flickr30K dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Current video object detection (VOD) models often encounter issues with over-aggregation due to redundant aggregation strategies, which perform feature aggregation on every frame. This results in suboptimal performance and increased computational complexity. In this work, we propose an image-level Object Detection Difficulty (ODD) metric to quantify the difficulty of detecting objects in a given image. The derived ODD scores can be used in the VOD process to mitigate over-aggregation. Specifically, we train an ODD predictor as an auxiliary head of a still-image object detector to compute the ODD score for each image based on the discrepancies between detection results and ground-truth bounding boxes. The ODD score enhances the VOD system in two ways: 1) it enables the VOD system to select superior global reference frames, thereby improving overall accuracy; and 2) it serves as an indicator in the newly designed ODD Scheduler to eliminate the aggregation of frames that are easy to detect, thus accelerating the VOD process. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that, when utilized for selecting global reference frames, ODD-VOD consistently enhances the accuracy of Global-frame-based VOD models. When employed for acceleration, ODD-VOD consistently improves the frames per second (FPS) by an average of 73.3% across 8 different VOD models without sacrificing accuracy. When combined, ODD-VOD attains state-of-the-art performance when competing with many VOD methods in both accuracy and speed. Our work represents a significant advancement towards making VOD more practical for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Existing visual tracking methods typically take an image patch as the reference of the target to perform tracking. However, a single image patch cannot provide a complete and precise concept of the target object as images are limited in their ability to abstract and can be ambiguous, which makes it difficult to track targets with drastic variations. In this paper, we propose the CiteTracker to enhance target modeling and inference in visual tracking by connecting images and text. Specifically, we develop a text generation module to convert the target image patch into a descriptive text containing its class and attribute information, providing a comprehensive reference point for the target. In addition, a dynamic description module is designed to adapt to target variations for more effective target representation. We then associate the target description and the search image using an attention-based correlation module to generate the correlated features for target state reference. Extensive experiments on five diverse datasets are conducted to evaluate the proposed algorithm and the favorable performance against the state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed tracking method.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In this paper we show how Group Equivariant Convolutional Neural Networks use subsampling to learn to break equivariance to their symmetries. We focus on 2D rotations and reflections and investigate the impact of broken equivariance on network performance. We show that a change in the input dimension of a network as small as a single pixel can be enough for commonly used architectures to become approximately equivariant, rather than exactly. We investigate the impact of networks not being exactly equivariant and find that approximately equivariant networks generalise significantly worse to unseen symmetries compared to their exactly equivariant counterparts. However, when the symmetries in the training data are not identical to the symmetries of the network, we find that approximately equivariant networks are able to relax their own equivariant constraints, causing them to match or outperform exactly equivariant networks on common benchmark datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Humans effortlessly infer the 3D shape of objects. What computations underlie this ability? Although various computational models have been proposed, none of them capture the human ability to match object shape across viewpoints. Here, we ask whether and how this gap might be closed. We begin with a relatively novel class of computational models, 3D neural fields, which encapsulate the basic principles of classic analysis-by-synthesis in a deep neural network (DNN). First, we find that a 3D Light Field Network (3D-LFN) supports 3D matching judgments well aligned to humans for within-category comparisons, adversarially-defined comparisons that accentuate the 3D failure cases of standard DNN models, and adversarially-defined comparisons for algorithmically generated shapes with no category structure. We then investigate the source of the 3D-LFN’s ability to achieve human-aligned performance through a series of computational experiments. Exposure to multiple viewpoints of objects during training and a multi-view learning objective are the primary factors behind model-human alignment; even conventional DNN architectures come much closer to human behavior when trained with multi-view objectives. Finally, we find that while the models trained with multi-view learning objectives are able to partially generalize to new object categories, they fall short of human alignment. This work provides a foundation for understanding human shape inferences within neurally mappable computational architectures and highlights important questions for future work.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a pathological condition characterized by bleeding inside the skull or brain, which can be attributed to various factors. Identifying, localizing and quantifying ICH has important clinical implications, in a bleed-dependent manner. While deep learning techniques are widely used in medical image segmentation and have been applied to the ICH segmentation task, existing public ICH datasets do not support the multi-class segmentation problem. To address this, we develop the Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD), which provides a 3D multi-class ICH dataset containing 192 volumes with pixel-level annotations and 2200 volumes with slice-level annotations across five categories of ICH. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we formulate a series of supervised and semi-supervised ICH segmentation tasks. We provide experimental results with state-of-the-art models as reference benchmarks for further model developments and evaluations on this dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The quality of a wood log in the wood industry depends heavily on the presence of both outer and inner defects, including inner knots that are a result of the growth of tree branches. Today, locating the inner knots require the use of expensive equipment such as X-ray scanners. In this paper, we address the task of predicting the location of inner defects from the outer shape of the logs. The dataset is built by extracting both the contours and the knots with X-ray measurements. We propose to solve this binary segmentation task by leveraging convolutional recurrent neural networks. Once the neural network is trained, inference can be performed from the outer shape measured with cheap devices such as laser profilers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on fir and spruce tree species and perform ablation on the recurrence to demonstrate its importance.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>T1 mapping is a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) technique that has emerged as a valuable tool in the diagnosis of diffuse myocardial diseases. However, prevailing approaches have relied heavily on breath-hold sequences to eliminate respiratory motion artifacts. This limitation hinders accessibility and effectiveness for patients who cannot tolerate breath-holding. Image registration can be used to enable free-breathing T1 mapping. Yet, inherent intensity differences between the different time points make the registration task challenging. We introduce PCMC-T1, a physically-constrained deep-learning model for motion correction in free-breathing T1 mapping. We incorporate the signal decay model into the network architecture to encourage physically-plausible deformations along the longitudinal relaxation axis. We compared PCMC-T1 to baseline deep-learning-based image registration approaches using a 5-fold experimental setup on a publicly available dataset of 210 patients. PCMC-T1 demonstrated superior model fitting quality (R2: 0.955) and achieved the highest clinical impact (clinical score: 3.93) compared to baseline methods (0.941, 0.946 and 3.34, 3.62 respectively). Anatomical alignment results were comparable (Dice score: 0.9835 vs. 0.984, 0.988).

<p>Abstract:<br>Motivated by the challenges of the Digital Ancient Near Eastern Studies (DANES) community, we develop digital tools for processing cuneiform script being a 3D script imprinted into clay tablets used for more than three millennia and at least eight major languages. It consists of thousands of characters that have changed over time and space. Photographs are the most common representations usable for machine learning, while ink drawings are prone to interpretation. Best suited 3D datasets that are becoming available. We created and used the HeiCuBeDa and MaiCuBeDa datasets, which consist of around 500 annotated tablets. For our novel OCR-like approach to mixed image data, we provide an additional mapping tool for transferring annotations between 3D renderings and photographs. Our sign localization uses a RepPoints detector to predict the locations of characters as bounding boxes. We use image data from GigaMesh’s MSII (curvature, see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gigamesh.eu/">https://gigamesh.eu</a>) based rendering, Phong-shaded 3D models, and photographs as well as illumination augmentation. The results show that using rendered 3D images for sign detection performs better than other work on photographs. In addition, our approach gives reasonably good results for photographs only, while it is best used for mixed datasets. More importantly, the Phong renderings, and especially the MSII renderings, improve the results on photographs, which is the largest dataset on a global scale.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Generating both plausible and accurate full body avatar motion is the key to the quality of immersive experiences in mixed reality scenarios. Head-Mounted Devices (HMDs) typically only provide a few input signals, such as head and hands 6-DoF. Recently, different approaches achieved impressive performance in generating full body motion given only head and hands signal. However, to the best of our knowledge, all existing approaches rely on full hand visibility. While this is the case when, e.g., using motion controllers, a considerable proportion of mixed reality experiences do not involve motion controllers and instead rely on egocentric hand tracking. This introduces the challenge of partial hand visibility owing to the restricted field of view of the HMD. In this paper, we propose the first unified approach, HMD-NeMo, that addresses plausible and accurate full body motion generation even when the hands may be only partially visible. HMD-NeMo is a lightweight neural network that predicts the full body motion in an online and real-time fashion. At the heart of HMD-NeMo is the spatio-temporal encoder with novel temporally adaptable mask tokens that encourage plausible motion in the absence of hand observations. We perform extensive analysis of the impact of different components in HMD-NeMo and introduce a new state-of-the-art on AMASS dataset through our evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Previous work on long-term video action recognition relies on deep 3D-convolutional models that have a large temporal receptive field (RF). We argue that these models are not always the best choice for temporal modeling in videos. A large temporal receptive field allows the model to encode the exact sub-action order of a video, which causes a performance decrease when testing videos have a different sub-action order. In this work, we investigate whether we can improve the model robustness to the sub-action order by shrinking the temporal receptive field of action recognition models. For this, we design Video BagNet, a variant of the 3D ResNet-50 model with the temporal receptive field size limited to 1, 9, 17 or 33 frames. We analyze Video BagNet on synthetic and real-world video datasets and experimentally compare models with varying temporal receptive fields. We find that short receptive fields are robust to sub-action order changes, while larger temporal receptive fields are sensitive to the sub-action order.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Many real-world applications, from sport analysis to surveillance, benefit from automatic long-term action recognition. In the current deep learning paradigm for automatic action recognition, it is imperative that models are trained and tested on datasets and tasks that evaluate if such models actually learn and reason over long-term information. In this work, we propose a method to evaluate how suitable a video dataset is to evaluate models for long-term action recognition. To this end, we define a long-term action as excluding all the videos that can be correctly recognized using solely short-term information. We test this definition on existing long-term classification tasks on three popular real-world datasets, namely Breakfast, CrossTask and LVU, to determine if these datasets are truly evaluating long-term recognition. Our study reveals that these datasets can be effectively solved using shortcuts based on short-term information. Following this finding, we encourage long-term action recognition researchers to make use of datasets that need long-term information to be solved.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Learning object segmentation in image and video datasets without human supervision is a challenging problem. Humans easily identify moving salient objects in videos using the gestalt principle of common fate, which suggests that what moves together belongs together. Building upon this idea, we propose a self-supervised object discovery approach that leverages motion and appearance information to produce high-quality object segmentation masks. Specifically, we redesign the traditional graph cut on images to include motion information in a linear combination with appearance information to produce edge weights. Remarkably, this step produces object segmentation masks comparable to the current state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks. To further improve performance, we bootstrap a segmentation network trained on these preliminary masks as pseudo-ground truths to learn from its own outputs via self-training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, named LOCATE, on multiple standard video object segmentation, image saliency detection, and object segmentation benchmarks, achieving results on par with and, in many cases surpassing state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the transferability of our approach to novel domains through a qualitative study on in-the-wild images. Additionally, we present extensive ablation analysis to support our design choices and highlight the contribution of each component of our proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Visual affordance segmentation identifies the surfaces of an object an agent can interact with. Common challenges for the identification of affordances are the variety of the geometry and physical properties of these surfaces as well as occlusions. In this paper, we focus on occlusions of an object that is hand-held by a person manipulating it. To address this challenge, we propose an affordance segmentation model that uses auxiliary branches to process the object and hand regions separately. The proposed model learns affordance features under hand-occlusion by weighting the feature map through hand and object segmentation. To train the model, we annotated the visual affordances of an existing dataset with mixed-reality images of hand-held containers in third-person (exocentric) images. Experiments on both real and mixed-reality images show that our model achieves better affordance segmentation and generalisation than existing models.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Modern computer vision services often require users to share raw feature descriptors with an untrusted server. This presents an inherent privacy risk, as raw descriptors may be used to recover the source images from which they were extracted. To address this issue, researchers recently proposed privatizing image features by embedding them within an affine subspace containing the original feature as well as adversarial feature samples. In this paper, we propose two novel inversion attacks to show that it is possible to (approximately) recover the original image features from these embeddings, allowing us to recover privacy-critical image content. In light of such successes and the lack of theoretical privacy guarantees afforded by existing visual privacy methods, we further propose the first method to privatize image features via local differential privacy, which, unlike prior approaches, provides a guaranteed bound for privacy leakage regardless of the strength of the attacks. In addition, our method yields strong performance in visual localization as a downstream task while enjoying the privacy guarantee.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Cross-modal garment synthesis and manipulation will significantly benefit the way fashion designers generate garments and modify their designs via flexible linguistic interfaces.Current approaches follow the general text-to-image paradigm and mine cross-modal relations via simple cross-attention modules, neglecting the structural correspondence between visual and textual representations in the fashion design domain. In this work, we instead introduce DiffCloth, a diffusion-based pipeline for cross-modal garment synthesis and manipulation, which empowers diffusion models with flexible compositionality in the fashion domain by structurally aligning the cross-modal semantics. Specifically, we formulate the part-level cross-modal alignment as a bipartite matching problem between the linguistic Attribute-Phrases (AP) and the visual garment parts which are obtained via constituency parsing and semantic segmentation, respectively. To mitigate the issue of attribute confusion, we further propose a semantic-bundled cross-attention to preserve the spatial structure similarities between the attention maps of attribute adjectives and part nouns in each AP. Moreover, DiffCloth allows for manipulation of the generated results by simply replacing APs in the text prompts. The manipulation-irrelevant regions are recognized by blended masks obtained from the bundled attention maps of the APs and kept unchanged. Extensive experiments on the CM-Fashion benchmark demonstrate that DiffCloth both yields state-of-the-art garment synthesis results by leveraging the inherent structural information and supports flexible manipulation with region consistency.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Few-shot segmentation (FSS) is a dense prediction task that aims to infer the pixel-wise labels of unseen classes using only a limited number of annotated images. The key challenge in FSS is to classify the labels of query pixels using class prototypes learned from the few labeled support exemplars. Prior approaches to FSS have typically focused on learning class-wise descriptors independently from support images, thereby ignoring the rich contextual information and mutual dependencies among support-query features. To address this limitation, we propose a joint learning method termed Masked Cross-Image Encoding (MCE), which is designed to capture common visual properties that describe object details and to learn bidirectional inter-image dependencies that enhance feature interaction. MCE is more than a visual representation enrichment module; it also considers cross-image mutual dependencies and implicit guidance. Experiments on FSS benchmarks PASCAL-$5^i$ and COCO-$20^i$ demonstrate the advanced meta-learning ability of the proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Transformers have demonstrated tremendous success not only in the natural language processing (NLP) domain but also the field of computer vision, igniting various creative approaches and applications. Yet, the superior performance and modeling flexibility of transformers came with a severe increase in computation costs, and hence several works have proposed methods to reduce this burden. Inspired by a cost-cutting method originally proposed for language models, Data Multiplexing (DataMUX), we propose a novel approach for efficient visual recognition that employs additional dim1 batching (i.e., concatenation) that greatly improves the throughput with little compromise in the accuracy. We first introduce a naive adaptation of DataMux for vision models, Image Multiplexer, and devise novel components to overcome its weaknesses, rendering our final model, ConcatPlexer, at the sweet spot between inference speed and accuracy. The ConcatPlexer was trained on ImageNet1K and CIFAR100 dataset and it achieved 23.5% less GFLOPs than ViT-B&#x2F;16 with 69.5% and 83.4% validation accuracy, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Hand-object interaction understanding and the barely addressed novel view synthesis are highly desired in the immersive communication, whereas it is challenging due to the high deformation of hand and heavy occlusions between hand and object. In this paper, we propose a neural rendering and pose estimation system for hand-object interaction from sparse views, which can also enable 3D hand-object interaction editing. We share the inspiration from recent scene understanding work that shows a scene specific model built beforehand can significantly improve and unblock vision tasks especially when inputs are sparse, and extend it to the dynamic hand-object interaction scenario and propose to solve the problem in two stages. We first learn the shape and appearance prior knowledge of hands and objects separately with the neural representation at the offline stage. During the online stage, we design a rendering-based joint model fitting framework to understand the dynamic hand-object interaction with the pre-built hand and object models as well as interaction priors, which thereby overcomes penetration and separation issues between hand and object and also enables novel view synthesis. In order to get stable contact during the hand-object interaction process in a sequence, we propose a stable contact loss to make the contact region to be consistent. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Abstract:<br>Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP and ALIGN, are generally trained on datasets consisting of image-caption pairs obtained from the web. However, real-world multimodal datasets, such as healthcare data, are significantly more complex: each image (e.g. X-ray) is often paired with text (e.g. physician report) that describes many distinct attributes occurring in fine-grained regions of the image. We refer to these samples as exhibiting high pairwise complexity, since each image-text pair can be decomposed into a large number of region-attribute pairings. The extent to which VLMs can capture fine-grained relationships between image regions and textual attributes when trained on such data has not been previously evaluated. The first key contribution of this work is to demonstrate through systematic evaluations that as the pairwise complexity of the training dataset increases, standard VLMs struggle to learn region-attribute relationships, exhibiting performance degradations of up to 37% on retrieval tasks. In order to address this issue, we introduce ViLLA as our second key contribution. ViLLA, which is trained to capture fine-grained region-attribute relationships from complex datasets, involves two components: (a) a lightweight, self-supervised mapping model to decompose image-text samples into region-attribute pairs, and (b) a contrastive VLM to learn representations from generated region-attribute pairs. We demonstrate with experiments across four domains (synthetic, product, medical, and natural images) that ViLLA outperforms comparable VLMs on fine-grained reasoning tasks, such as zero-shot object detection (up to 3.6 AP50 points on COCO and 0.6 mAP points on LVIS) and retrieval (up to 14.2 R-Precision points).</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Pre-trained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, working with manually designed prompts have demonstrated great capacity of transfer learning. Recently, learnable prompts achieve state-of-the-art performance, which however are prone to overfit to seen classes, failing to generalize to unseen classes. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge-Aware Prompt Tuning (KAPT) framework for vision-language models. Our approach takes inspiration from human intelligence in which external knowledge is usually incorporated into recognizing novel categories of objects. Specifically, we design two complementary types of knowledge-aware prompts for the text encoder to leverage the distinctive characteristics of category-related external knowledge. The discrete prompt extracts the key information from descriptions of an object category, and the learned continuous prompt captures overall contexts. We further design an adaptation head for the visual encoder to aggregate salient attentive visual cues, which establishes discriminative and task-aware visual representations. We conduct extensive experiments on 11 widely-used benchmark datasets and the results verify the effectiveness in few-shot image classification, especially in generalizing to unseen categories. Compared with the state-of-the-art CoCoOp method, KAPT exhibits favorable performance and achieves an absolute gain of 3.22% on new classes and 2.57% in terms of harmonic mean.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Previous research has studied the task of segmenting cinematic videos into scenes and into narrative acts. However, these studies have overlooked the essential task of multimodal alignment and fusion for effectively and efficiently processing long-form videos (&gt;60min). In this paper, we introduce Multimodal alignmEnt aGgregation and distillAtion (MEGA) for cinematic long-video segmentation. MEGA tackles the challenge by leveraging multiple media modalities. The method coarsely aligns inputs of variable lengths and different modalities with alignment positional encoding. To maintain temporal synchronization while reducing computation, we further introduce an enhanced bottleneck fusion layer which uses temporal alignment. Additionally, MEGA employs a novel contrastive loss to synchronize and transfer labels across modalities, enabling act segmentation from labeled synopsis sentences on video shots. Our experimental results show that MEGA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on MovieNet dataset for scene segmentation (with an Average Precision improvement of +1.19%) and on TRIPOD dataset for act segmentation (with a Total Agreement improvement of +5.51%)</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We present Recurrent Fitting (ReFit), a neural network architecture for single-image, parametric 3D human reconstruction. ReFit learns a feedback-update loop that mirrors the strategy of solving an inverse problem through optimization. At each iterative step, it reprojects keypoints from the human model to feature maps to query feedback, and uses a recurrent-based updater to adjust the model to fit the image better. Because ReFit encodes strong knowledge of the inverse problem, it is faster to train than previous regression models. At the same time, ReFit improves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. Moreover, ReFit applies to other optimization settings, such as multi-view fitting and single-view shape fitting.

<p>Abstract:<br>Simultaneous segmentation and classification of nuclei in digital histology play an essential role in computer-assisted cancer diagnosis; however, it remains challenging. The highest achieved binary and multi-class Panoptic Quality (PQ) remains as low as 0.68 bPQ and 0.49 mPQ, respectively. It is due to the higher staining variability, variability across the tissue, rough clinical conditions, overlapping nuclei, and nuclear class imbalance. The generic deep-learning methods usually rely on end-to-end models, which fail to address these problems associated explicitly with digital histology. In our previous work, DAN-NucNet, we resolved these issues for semantic segmentation with an end-to-end model. This work extends our previous model to simultaneous instance segmentation and classification. We introduce additional decoder heads with independent weighted losses, which produce semantic segmentation, edge proposals, and classification maps. We use the outputs from the three-head model to apply post-processing to produce the final segmentation and classification. Our multi-stage approach utilizes edge proposals and semantic segmentations compared to direct segmentation and classification strategies followed by most state-of-the-art methods. Due to this, we demonstrate a significant performance improvement in producing high-quality instance segmentation and nuclei classification. We have achieved a 0.841 Dice score for semantic segmentation, 0.713 bPQ scores for instance segmentation, and 0.633 mPQ for nuclei classification. Our proposed framework is generalized across 19 types of tissues. Furthermore, the framework is less complex compared to the state-of-the-art.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Engaging video comments play an important role in video social media, as they are the carrier of feelings, thoughts, or humor of the audience. Preliminary works have made initial exploration for video comment generation by adopting caption-style encoder-decoder models. However, comment generation presents some unique challenges distinct from caption generation, which makes these methods somewhat less effective at generating engaging comments. In contrast to the objective and descriptive nature of captions, comments tend to be inherently subjective, making it hard to quantify and evaluate the engagement of comments. Furthermore, the scarcity of truly engaging comments brings difficulty to collecting enough high-quality training examples. In this paper, we propose ViCo with three novel designs to tackle the above challenges for generating engaging Video Comments. Firstly, to quantify the engagement of comments, we utilize the number of “likes” each comment receives as a proxy of human preference after an appropriate debiasing procedure. Secondly, to automatically evaluate the engagement of comments, we train a reward model to align its judgment to the above proxy. Our user studies indicate that this reward model effectively aligns with human judgments. Lastly, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality comments, an initial generator is trained on readily available but noisy data to generate comments. Then the reward model is employed to offer feedback on the generated comments, thus optimizing the initial generator. To facilitate the research of video commenting, we collect a large video comment-dataset (ViCo-20k) with rich metadata from a popular video website. Experiments on ViCo-20k show that the comments generated by our ViCo model exhibit the best performance in terms of both quantitative and qualitative results, particularly when engagement is considered.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Impressive performance on point cloud semantic segmentation has been achieved by fully-supervised methods with large amounts of labelled data. As it is labour-intensive to acquire large-scale point cloud data with point-wise labels, many attempts have been made to explore learning 3D point cloud segmentation with limited annotations. Active learning is one of the effective strategies to achieve this purpose but is still under-explored. The most recent methods of this kind measure the uncertainty of each pre-divided region for manual labelling but they suffer from redundant information and require additional efforts for region division. This paper aims at addressing this issue by developing a hierarchical point-based active learning strategy. Specifically, we measure the uncertainty for each point by a hierarchical minimum margin uncertainty module which considers the contextual information at multiple levels. Then, a feature-distance suppression strategy is designed to select important and representative points for manual labelling. Besides, to better exploit the unlabelled data, we build a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on our active strategy. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNetV2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves 96.5% and 100% performance of fully-supervised baseline with only 0.07% and 0.1% training data, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art weakly-supervised and active learning methods.

<p>Abstract:<br>Misalignments between multi-modality images pose challenges in image fusion, manifesting as structural distortions and edge ghosts. Existing efforts commonly resort to registering first and fusing later, typically employing two cascaded stages for registration,i.e., coarse registration and fine registration. Both stages directly estimate the respective target deformation fields. In this paper, we argue that the separated two-stage registration is not compact, and the direct estimation of the target deformation fields is not accurate enough. To address these challenges, we propose a Cross-modality Multi-scale Progressive Dense Registration (C-MPDR) scheme, which accomplishes the coarse-to-fine registration exclusively using a one-stage optimization, thus improving the fusion performance of misaligned multi-modality images. Specifically, two pivotal components are involved, a dense Deformation Field Fusion (DFF) module and a Progressive Feature Fine (PFF) module. The DFF aggregates the predicted multi-scale deformation sub-fields at the current scale, while the PFF progressively refines the remaining misaligned features. Both work together to accurately estimate the final deformation fields. In addition, we develop a Transformer-Conv-based Fusion (TCF) subnetwork that considers local and long-range feature dependencies, allowing us to capture more informative features from the registered infrared and visible images for the generation of high-quality fused images. Extensive experimental analysis demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method in the fusion of misaligned cross-modality images.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In recent, some robust contrastive multi-view clustering (MvC) methods have been proposed, which construct data pairs from neighborhoods to alleviate the false negative issue, i.e., some intra-cluster samples are wrongly treated as negative pairs. Although promising performance has been achieved by these methods, the false negative issue is still far from addressed and the false positive issue emerges because all in- and out-of-neighborhood samples are simply treated as positive and negative, respectively. To address the issues, we propose a novel robust method, dubbed decoupled contrastive multi-view clustering with high-order random walks (DIVIDE). In brief, DIVIDE leverages random walks to progressively identify data pairs in a global instead of local manner. As a result, DIVIDE could identify in-neighborhood negatives and out-of-neighborhood positives. Moreover, DIVIDE embraces a novel MvC architecture to perform inter- and intra-view contrastive learning in different embedding spaces, thus boosting clustering performance and embracing the robustness against missing views. To verify the efficacy of DIVIDE, we carry out extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets comparing with nine state-of-the-art MvC methods in both complete and incomplete MvC settings.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. They include a group of malignant neoplasms with a variety of biological, clinical, and histopathological characteristics. There are more than 35 different histological forms of breast lesions that can be classified and diagnosed histologically according to cell morphology, growth, and architecture patterns. Recently, deep learning, in the field of artificial intelligence, has drawn a lot of attention for the computerized representation of medical images. Searchable digital atlases can provide pathologists with patch matching tools allowing them to search among evidently diagnosed and treated archival cases, a technology that may be regarded as computational second opinion. In this study, we indexed and analyzed the WHO breast taxonomy (Classification of Tumours 5th Ed.) spanning 35 tumour types. We visualized all tumour types using deep features extracted from a state-of-the-art deep learning model, pre-trained on millions of diagnostic histopathology images from the TCGA repository. Furthermore, we test the concept of a digital “atlas” as a reference for search and matching with rare test cases. The patch similarity search within the WHO breast taxonomy data reached over 88% accuracy when validating through “majority vote” and more than 91% accuracy when validating using top-n tumour types. These results show for the first time that complex relationships among common and rare breast lesions can be investigated using an indexed digital archive.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Among the current mainstream change detection networks, transformer is deficient in the ability to capture accurate low-level details, while convolutional neural network (CNN) is wanting in the capacity to understand global information and establish remote spatial relationships. Meanwhile, both of the widely used early fusion and late fusion frameworks are not able to well learn complete change features. Therefore, based on swin transformer V2 (Swin V2) and VGG16, we propose an end-to-end compounded dense network SwinV2DNet to inherit the advantages of both transformer and CNN and overcome the shortcomings of existing networks in feature learning. Firstly, it captures the change relationship features through the densely connected Swin V2 backbone, and provides the low-level pre-changed and post-changed features through a CNN branch. Based on these three change features, we accomplish accurate change detection results. Secondly, combined with transformer and CNN, we propose mixed feature pyramid (MFP) which provides inter-layer interaction information and intra-layer multi-scale information for complete feature learning. MFP is a plug and play module which is experimentally proven to be also effective in other change detection networks. Further more, we impose a self-supervision strategy to guide a new CNN branch, which solves the untrainable problem of the CNN branch and provides the semantic change information for the features of encoder. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) change detection scores and fine-grained change maps were obtained compared with other advanced methods on four commonly used public remote sensing datasets.

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper offers a new perspective to ease the challenge of domain generalization, which involves maintaining robust results even in unseen environments. Our design focuses on the decision-making process in the final classifier layer. Specifically, we propose treating the element-wise contributions to the final results as the rationale for making a decision and representing the rationale for each sample as a matrix. For a well-generalized model, we suggest the rationale matrices for samples belonging to the same category should be similar, indicating the model relies on domain-invariant clues to make decisions, thereby ensuring robust results. To implement this idea, we introduce a rationale invariance loss as a simple regularization technique, requiring only a few lines of code. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive results across various datasets, despite its simplicity.

<p>Abstract:<br>Video data and algorithms have been driving advances in multi-object tracking (MOT). While existing MOT datasets focus on occlusion and appearance similarity, complex motion patterns are widespread yet overlooked. To address this issue, we introduce a new dataset called BEE23 to highlight complex motions. Identity association algorithms have long been the focus of MOT research. Existing trackers can be categorized into two association paradigms: single-feature paradigm (based on either motion or appearance feature) and serial paradigm (one feature serves as secondary while the other is primary). However, these paradigms are incapable of fully utilizing different features. In this paper, we propose a parallel paradigm and present the Two rOund Parallel matchIng meChanism (TOPIC) to implement it. The TOPIC leverages both motion and appearance features and can adaptively select the preferable one as the assignment metric based on motion level. Moreover, we provide an Attention-based Appearance Reconstruct Module (AARM) to reconstruct appearance feature embeddings, thus enhancing the representation of appearance features. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets and BEE23. Notably, our proposed parallel paradigm surpasses the performance of existing association paradigms by a large margin, e.g., reducing false negatives by 12% to 51% compared to the single-feature association paradigm. The introduced dataset and association paradigm in this work offers a fresh perspective for advancing the MOT field.

<p>Abstract:<br>The success of supervised deep learning models on cell recognition tasks relies on detailed annotations. Many previous works have managed to reduce the dependency on labels. However, considering the large number of cells contained in a patch, costly and inefficient labeling is still inevitable. To this end, we explored label-free methods for cell recognition. Prior self-activation maps (PSM) are proposed to generate pseudo masks as training targets. To be specific, an activation network is trained with self-supervised learning. The gradient information in the shallow layers of the network is aggregated to generate prior self-activation maps. Afterward, a semantic clustering module is then introduced as a pipeline to transform PSMs to pixel-level semantic pseudo masks for downstream tasks. We evaluated our method on two histological datasets: MoNuSeg (cell segmentation) and BCData (multi-class cell detection). Compared with other fully-supervised and weakly-supervised methods, our method can achieve competitive performance without any manual annotations. Our simple but effective framework can also achieve multi-class cell detection which can not be done by existing unsupervised methods. The results show the potential of PSMs that might inspire other research to deal with the hunger for labels in medical area.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>High dynamic range (HDR) imaging is a highly challenging task since a large amount of information is lost due to the limitations of camera sensors. For HDR imaging, some methods capture multiple low dynamic range (LDR) images with altering exposures to aggregate more information. However, these approaches introduce ghosting artifacts when significant inter-frame motions are present. Moreover, although multi-exposure images are given, we have little information in severely over-exposed areas. Most existing methods focus on motion compensation, i.e., alignment of multiple LDR shots to reduce the ghosting artifacts, but they still produce unsatisfying results. These methods also rather overlook the need to restore the saturated areas. In this paper, we generate well-aligned multi-exposure features by reformulating a motion alignment problem into a simple brightness adjustment problem. In addition, we propose a coarse-to-fine merging strategy with explicit saturation compensation. The saturated areas are reconstructed with similar well-exposed content using adaptive contextual attention. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods regarding qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recent work on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has demonstrated significant advances in high-quality view synthesis. A major limitation of NeRF is its low rendering efficiency due to the need for multiple network forwardings to render a single pixel. Existing methods to improve NeRF either reduce the number of required samples or optimize the implementation to accelerate the network forwarding. Despite these efforts, the problem of multiple sampling persists due to the intrinsic representation of radiance fields. In contrast, Neural Light Fields (NeLF) reduce the computation cost of NeRF by querying only one single network forwarding per pixel. To achieve a close visual quality to NeRF, existing NeLF methods require significantly larger network capacities which limits their rendering efficiency in practice. In this work, we propose a new representation called Neural Radiance Distribution Field (NeRDF) that targets efficient view synthesis in real-time. Specifically, we use a small network similar to NeRF while preserving the rendering speed with a single network forwarding per pixel as in NeLF. The key is to model the radiance distribution along each ray with frequency basis and predict frequency weights using the network. Pixel values are then computed via volume rendering on radiance distributions. Experiments show that our proposed method offers a better trade-off among speed, quality, and network size than existing methods: we achieve a ~254x speed-up over NeRF with similar network size, with only a marginal performance decline.

<p>Abstract:<br>Generative models have seen an explosion in popularity with the release of huge generative Diffusion models like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion to the public. Because of this new ease of access, questions surrounding the automated collection of data and issues regarding content ownership have started to build. In this paper we present new work which aims to provide ways of protecting content when shared to the public. We show that a generative Diffusion model trained on data that has been imperceptibly watermarked will generate new images with these watermarks present. We further show that if a given watermark is correlated with a certain feature of the training data, the generated images will also have this correlation. Using statistical tests we show that we are able to determine whether a model has been trained on marked data, and what data was marked. As a result our system offers a solution to protect intellectual property when sharing content online.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper presents a novel method that leverages a visual-language model, CLIP, as a data source for zero-shot anomaly detection. Tremendous efforts have been put towards developing anomaly detectors due to their potential industrial applications. Considering the difficulty in acquiring various anomalous samples for training, most existing methods train models with only normal samples and measure discrepancies from the distribution of normal samples during inference, which requires training a model for each object category. The problem of this inefficient training requirement has been tackled by designing a CLIP-based anomaly detector that applies prompt-guided classification to each part of an image in a sliding window manner. However, the method still suffers from the labor of careful prompt ensembling with known object categories. To overcome the issues above, we propose leveraging CLIP as a data source for training. Our method generates text embeddings with the text encoder in CLIP with typical prompts that include words of normal and anomaly. In addition to these words, we insert several randomly generated words into prompts, which enables the encoder to generate a diverse set of normal and anomalous samples. Using the generated embeddings as training data, a feed-forward neural network learns to extract features of normal and anomaly from CLIP’s embeddings, and as a result, a category-agnostic anomaly detector can be obtained without any training images. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without laborious prompt ensembling in zero-shot setups.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>As demands for high-quality videos continue to rise, high-resolution and high-dynamic range (HDR) imaging techniques are drawing attention. To generate an HDR video from low dynamic range (LDR) images, one of the critical steps is the motion compensation between LDR frames, for which most existing works employed the optical flow algorithm. However, these methods suffer from flow estimation errors when saturation or complicated motions exist. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end HDR video composition framework, which aligns LDR frames in the feature space and then merges aligned features into an HDR frame, without relying on pixel-domain optical flow. Specifically, we propose a luminance-based alignment network for HDR (LAN-HDR) consisting of an alignment module and a hallucination module. The alignment module aligns a frame to the adjacent reference by evaluating luminance-based attention, excluding color information. The hallucination module generates sharp details, especially for washed-out areas due to saturation. The aligned and hallucinated features are then blended adaptively to complement each other. Finally, we merge the features to generate a final HDR frame. In training, we adopt a temporal loss, in addition to frame reconstruction losses, to enhance temporal consistency and thus reduce flickering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method performs better or comparable to state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This paper proposes a novel quantum pre-processing filter (QPF) to improve the image classification accuracy of neural network (NN) models. A simple four qubit quantum circuit that uses Y rotation gates for encoding and two controlled NOT gates for creating correlation among the qubits is applied as a feature extraction filter prior to passing data into the fully connected NN architecture. By applying the QPF approach, the results show that the image classification accuracy based on the MNIST (handwritten 10 digits) and the EMNIST (handwritten 47 class digits and letters) datasets can be improved, from 92.5% to 95.4% and from 68.9% to 75.9%, respectively. These improvements were obtained without introducing extra model parameters or optimizations in the machine learning process. However, tests performed on the developed QPF approach against a relatively complex GTSRB dataset with 43 distinct class real-life traffic sign images showed a degradation in the classification accuracy. Considering this result, further research into the understanding and the design of a more suitable quantum circuit approach for image classification neural networks could be explored utilizing the baseline method proposed in this paper.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>The Automated Model Evaluation (AutoEval) framework entertains the possibility of evaluating a trained machine learning model without resorting to a labeled testing set. Despite the promise and some decent results, the existing AutoEval methods heavily rely on computing distribution shifts between the unlabelled testing set and the training set. We believe this reliance on the training set becomes another obstacle in shipping this technology to real-world ML development. In this work, we propose Contrastive Automatic Model Evaluation (CAME), a novel AutoEval framework that is rid of involving training set in the loop. The core idea of CAME bases on a theoretical analysis which bonds the model performance with a contrastive loss. Further, with extensive empirical validation, we manage to set up a predictable relationship between the two, simply by deducing on the unlabeled&#x2F;unseen testing set. The resulting framework CAME establishes a new SOTA results for AutoEval by surpassing prior work significantly.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In Asian countries, there is a tradition that a rabbit (the Moon rabbit) lives on the Moon. As the origin of this tradition, usually, two reasons are mentioned. One reason is that the color pattern of the lunar surface is similar to the shape of a rabbit. The other reason is that both the Moon and rabbit are symbols of fertility because the Moon appears and disappears (i.e., waxing and waning) cyclically, and rabbits bear children frequently. Considering the latter reason, is the lunar surface color pattern not similar to a rabbit? Here, the similarity between rabbit and the lunar surface pattern was evaluated using seven AI architectures. In the test by CLIP, assuming that people look at the Moon in the early evening frequently, the lunar surface is more similar to a rabbit than a face at low latitude regions, while it can be classified as face as latitude increases, which is consistent with that the oldest literature about the Moon rabbit was written in India and that there is a culture of human’s face in the Moon in Europe. Tested with ImageNet weights, ConvNeXt and CLIP sometimes classified the lunar surface pattern into rabbit with relatively high probabilities. Cultures are generated by our attitude to the environment. Both dynamic and static similarities may be required to induce our imagination.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>A novel algorithm to detect road lanes in videos, called recursive video lane detector (RVLD), is proposed in this paper, which propagates the state of a current frame recursively to the next frame. RVLD consists of an intra-frame lane detector (ILD) and a predictive lane detector (PLD). First, we design ILD to localize lanes in a still frame. Second, we develop PLD to exploit the information of the previous frame for lane detection in a current frame. To this end, we estimate a motion field and warp the previous output to the current frame. Using the warped information, we refine the feature map of the current frame to detect lanes more reliably. Experimental results show that RVLD outperforms existing detectors on video lane datasets.

<p>Abstract:<br>Quantum machine learning and vision have come to the fore recently, with hardware advances enabling rapid advancement in the capabilities of quantum machines. Recently, quantum image generation has been explored with many potential advantages over non-quantum techniques; however, previous techniques have suffered from poor quality and robustness. To address these problems, we introduce, MosaiQ, a high-quality quantum image generation GAN framework that can be executed on today’s Near-term Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We present an architecture and a training recipe that adapts pre-trained open-world image models to localization in videos. Understanding the open visual world (without being constrained by fixed label spaces) is crucial for many real-world vision tasks. Contrastive pre-training on large image-text datasets has recently led to significant improvements for image-level tasks. For more structured tasks involving object localization applying pre-trained models is more challenging. This is particularly true for video tasks, where task-specific data is limited. We show successful transfer of open-world models by building on the OWL-ViT open-vocabulary detection model and adapting it to video by adding a transformer decoder. The decoder propagates object representations recurrently through time by using the output tokens for one frame as the object queries for the next. Our model is end-to-end trainable on video data and enjoys improved temporal consistency compared to tracking-by-detection baselines, while retaining the open-world capabilities of the backbone detector. We evaluate our model on the challenging TAO-OW benchmark and demonstrate that open-world capabilities, learned from large-scale image-text pre-training, can be transferred successfully to open-world localization across diverse videos.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Algorithmic Fairness and the explainability of potentially unfair outcomes are crucial for establishing trust and accountability of Artificial Intelligence systems in domains such as healthcare and policing. Though significant advances have been made in each of the fields separately, achieving explainability in fairness applications remains challenging, particularly so in domains where deep neural networks are used. At the same time, ethical data-mining has become ever more relevant, as it has been shown countless times that fairness-unaware algorithms result in biased outcomes. Current approaches focus on mitigating biases in the outcomes of the model, but few attempts have been made to try to explain \emph{why} a model is biased. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive approach that leverages optimal transport theory to uncover the causes and implications of biased regions in images, which easily extends to tabular data as well. Through the use of Wasserstein barycenters, we obtain scores that are independent of a sensitive variable but keep their marginal orderings. This step ensures predictive accuracy but also helps us to recover the regions most associated with the generation of the biases. Our findings hold significant implications for the development of trustworthy and unbiased AI systems, fostering transparency, accountability, and fairness in critical decision-making scenarios across diverse domains.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Predicting high dimensional video sequences is a curiously difficult problem. The number of possible futures for a given video sequence grows exponentially over time due to uncertainty. This is especially evident when trying to predict complicated natural video scenes from a limited snapshot of the world. The inherent uncertainty accumulates the further into the future you predict making long-term prediction very difficult. In this work we introduce a number of improvements to existing work that aid in creating Robust Video Predictors (RoViPs). We show that with a combination of deep Perceptual and uncertainty-based reconstruction losses we are able to create high quality short-term predictions. Attention-based skip connections are utilised to allow for long range spatial movement of input features to further improve performance. Finally, we show that by simply making the predictor robust to its own prediction errors, it is possible to produce very long, realistic natural video sequences using an iterated single-step prediction task.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In this paper, we introduce audio-visual class-incremental learning, a class-incremental learning scenario for audio-visual video recognition. We demonstrate that joint audio-visual modeling can improve class-incremental learning, but current methods fail to preserve semantic similarity between audio and visual features as incremental step grows. Furthermore, we observe that audio-visual correlations learned in previous tasks can be forgotten as incremental steps progress, leading to poor performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose AV-CIL, which incorporates Dual-Audio-Visual Similarity Constraint (D-AVSC) to maintain both instance-aware and class-aware semantic similarity between audio-visual modalities and Visual Attention Distillation (VAD) to retain previously learned audio-guided visual attentive ability. We create three audio-visual class-incremental datasets, AVE-Class-Incremental (AVE-CI), Kinetics-Sounds-Class-Incremental (K-S-CI), and VGGSound100-Class-Incremental (VS100-CI) based on the AVE, Kinetics-Sounds, and VGGSound datasets, respectively. Our experiments on AVE-CI, K-S-CI, and VS100-CI demonstrate that AV-CIL significantly outperforms existing class-incremental learning methods in audio-visual class-incremental learning.

<p>Abstract:<br>Video anomaly detection (VAD) without human monitoring is a complex computer vision task that can have a positive impact on society if implemented successfully. While recent advances have made significant progress in solving this task, most existing approaches overlook a critical real-world concern: privacy. With the increasing popularity of artificial intelligence technologies, it becomes crucial to implement proper AI ethics into their development. Privacy leakage in VAD allows models to pick up and amplify unnecessary biases related to people’s personal information, which may lead to undesirable decision making. In this paper, we propose TeD-SPAD, a privacy-aware video anomaly detection framework that destroys visual private information in a self-supervised manner. In particular, we propose the use of a temporally-distinct triplet loss to promote temporally discriminative features, which complements current weakly-supervised VAD methods. Using TeD-SPAD, we achieve a positive trade-off between privacy protection and utility anomaly detection performance on three popular weakly supervised VAD datasets: UCF-Crime, XD-Violence, and ShanghaiTech. Our proposed anonymization model reduces private attribute prediction by 32.25% while only reducing frame-level ROC AUC on the UCF-Crime anomaly detection dataset by 3.69%.

<p>Abstract:<br>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success in various applications including video action recognition, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks (Trojans). The backdoor-compromised model will mis-classify to the target class chosen by the attacker when a test instance (from a non-target class) is embedded with a specific trigger, while maintaining high accuracy on attack-free instances. Although there are extensive studies on backdoor attacks against image data, the susceptibility of video-based systems under backdoor attacks remains largely unexplored. Current studies are direct extensions of approaches proposed for image data, e.g., the triggers are \textbf{independently} embedded within the frames, which tend to be detectable by existing defenses. In this paper, we introduce a \textit{simple} yet \textit{effective} backdoor attack against video data. Our proposed attack, adding perturbations in a transformed domain, plants an \textbf{imperceptible, temporally distributed} trigger across the video frames, and is shown to be resilient to existing defensive strategies. The effectiveness of the proposed attack is demonstrated by extensive experiments with various well-known models on two video recognition benchmarks, UCF101 and HMDB51, and a sign language recognition benchmark, Greek Sign Language (GSL) dataset. We delve into the impact of several influential factors on our proposed attack and identify an intriguing effect termed “collateral damage” through extensive studies.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In this paper, we consider a real-world scenario where a model that is trained on pre-defined classes continually encounters unlabeled data that contains both known and novel classes. The goal is to continually discover novel classes while maintaining the performance in known classes. We name the setting Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD). Existing methods for novel class discovery cannot directly handle the C-GCD setting due to some unrealistic assumptions, such as the unlabeled data only containing novel classes. Furthermore, they fail to discover novel classes in a continual fashion. In this work, we lift all these assumptions and propose an approach, called MetaGCD, to learn how to incrementally discover with less forgetting. Our proposed method uses a meta-learning framework and leverages the offline labeled data to simulate the testing incremental learning process. A meta-objective is defined to revolve around two conflicting learning objectives to achieve novel class discovery without forgetting. Furthermore, a soft neighborhood-based contrastive network is proposed to discriminate uncorrelated images while attracting correlated images. We build strong baselines and conduct extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks to demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>While large-scale image-text pretrained models such as CLIP have been used for multiple video-level tasks on trimmed videos, their use for temporal localization in untrimmed videos is still a relatively unexplored task. We design a new approach for this called UnLoc, which uses pretrained image and text towers, and feeds tokens to a video-text fusion model. The output of the fusion module are then used to construct a feature pyramid in which each level connects to a head to predict a per-frame relevancy score and start&#x2F;end time displacements. Unlike previous works, our architecture enables Moment Retrieval, Temporal Localization, and Action Segmentation with a single stage model, without the need for action proposals, motion based pretrained features or representation masking. Unlike specialized models, we achieve state of the art results on all three different localization tasks with a unified approach.

<p>Abstract:<br>In recent years, several Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WS3) methods have been proposed that use class activation maps (CAMs) generated by a classifier to produce pseudo-ground truths for training segmentation models. While CAMs are good at highlighting discriminative regions (DR) of an image, they are known to disregard regions of the object that do not contribute to the classifier’s prediction, termed non-discriminative regions (NDR). In contrast, attribution methods such as saliency maps provide an alternative approach for assigning a score to every pixel based on its contribution to the classification prediction. This paper provides a comprehensive comparison between saliencies and CAMs for WS3. Our study includes multiple perspectives on understanding their similarities and dissimilarities. Moreover, we provide new evaluation metrics that perform a comprehensive assessment of WS3 performance of alternative methods w.r.t. CAMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of saliencies in addressing the limitation of CAMs through our empirical studies on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we propose random cropping as a stochastic aggregation technique that improves the performance of saliency, making it a strong alternative to CAM for WS3.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>For machine learning-based prognosis and diagnosis of rare diseases, such as pediatric brain tumors, it is necessary to gather medical imaging data from multiple clinical sites that may use different devices and protocols. Deep learning-driven harmonization of radiologic images relies on generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs notoriously generate pseudo structures that do not exist in the original training data, a phenomenon known as “hallucination”. To prevent hallucination in medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain, we propose a one-shot learning method where we utilize neural style transfer for harmonization. At test time, the method uses one image from a clinical site to generate an image that matches the intensity scale of the collaborating sites. Our approach combines learning a feature extractor, neural style transfer, and adaptive instance normalization. We further propose a novel strategy to evaluate the effectiveness of image harmonization approaches with evaluation metrics that both measure image style harmonization and assess the preservation of anatomical structures. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in preserving patient anatomy while adjusting the image intensities to a new clinical site. Our general harmonization model can be used on unseen data from new sites, making it a valuable tool for real-world medical applications and clinical trials.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>In recent years, huge progress has been made on learning neural implicit representations from multi-view images for 3D reconstruction. As an additional input complementing coordinates, using sinusoidal functions as positional encodings plays a key role in revealing high frequency details with coordinate-based neural networks. However, high frequency positional encodings make the optimization unstable, which results in noisy reconstructions and artifacts in empty space. To resolve this issue in a general sense, we introduce to learn neural implicit representations with quantized coordinates, which reduces the uncertainty and ambiguity in the field during optimization. Instead of continuous coordinates, we discretize continuous coordinates into discrete coordinates using nearest interpolation among quantized coordinates which are obtained by discretizing the field in an extremely high resolution. We use discrete coordinates and their positional encodings to learn implicit functions through volume rendering. This significantly reduces the variations in the sample space, and triggers more multi-view consistency constraints on intersections of rays from different views, which enables to infer implicit function in a more effective way. Our quantized coordinates do not bring any computational burden, and can seamlessly work upon the latest methods. Our evaluations under the widely used benchmarks show our superiority over the state-of-the-art.

<p>Abstract:<br>There are many ways of interpreting the world and they are highly interdependent. We exploit such complex dependencies and introduce a powerful multi-task hypergraph, in which every node is a task and different paths through the hypergraph reaching a given task become unsupervised teachers, by forming ensembles that learn to generate reliable pseudolabels for that task. Each hyperedge is part of an ensemble teacher for a given task and it is also a student of the self-supervised hypergraph system. We apply our model to one of the most important problems of our times, that of Earth Observation, which is highly multi-task and it often suffers from missing ground-truth data. By performing extensive experiments on the NASA NEO Dataset, spanning a period of 22 years, we demonstrate the value of our multi-task semi-supervised approach, by consistent improvements over strong baselines and recent work. We also show that the hypergraph can adapt unsupervised to gradual data distribution shifts and reliably recover, through its multi-task self-supervision process, the missing data for several observational layers for up to seven years.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We propose a novel transformer-based framework that reconstructs two high fidelity hands from multi-view RGB images. Unlike existing hand pose estimation methods, where one typically trains a deep network to regress hand model parameters from single RGB image, we consider a more challenging problem setting where we directly regress the absolute root poses of two-hands with extended forearm at high resolution from egocentric view. As existing datasets are either infeasible for egocentric viewpoints or lack background variations, we create a large-scale synthetic dataset with diverse scenarios and collect a real dataset from multi-calibrated camera setup to verify our proposed multi-view image feature fusion strategy. To make the reconstruction physically plausible, we propose two strategies: (i) a coarse-to-fine spectral graph convolution decoder to smoothen the meshes during upsampling and (ii) an optimisation-based refinement stage at inference to prevent self-penetrations. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that our framework is able to produce realistic two-hand reconstructions and demonstrate the generalisation of synthetic-trained models to real data, as well as real-time AR&#x2F;VR applications.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases, and its short atmospheric half-life makes it a prime target to rapidly curb global warming. However, current methane emission monitoring techniques primarily rely on approximate emission factors or self-reporting, which have been shown to often dramatically underestimate emissions. Although initially designed to monitor surface properties, satellite multispectral data has recently emerged as a powerful method to analyze atmospheric content. However, the spectral resolution of multispectral instruments is poor, and methane measurements are typically very noisy. Methane data products are also sensitive to absorption by the surface and other atmospheric gases (water vapor in particular) and therefore provide noisy maps of potential methane plumes, that typically require extensive human analysis. Here, we show that the image recognition capabilities of deep learning methods can be leveraged to automatize the detection of methane leaks in Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral data, with dramatically reduced false positive rates compared with state-of-the-art multispectral methane data products, and without the need for a priori knowledge of potential leak sites. Our proposed approach paves the way for the automated, high-definition and high-frequency monitoring of point-source methane emissions across the world.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Functional tissue Units (FTUs) are cell population neighborhoods local to a particular organ performing its main function. The FTUs provide crucial information to the pathologist in understanding the disease affecting a particular organ by providing information at the cellular level. In our research, we have developed a model to segment multi-organ FTUs across 5 organs namely: the kidney, large intestine, lung, prostate and spleen by utilizing the HuBMAP + HPA - Hacking the Human Body competition dataset. We propose adding shifted auxiliary loss for training models like the transformers to overcome the diminishing gradient problem which poses a challenge towards optimal training of deep models. Overall, our model achieved a dice score of 0.793 on the public dataset and 0.778 on the private dataset and shows a 1% improvement with the use of the proposed method. The findings also bolster the use of transformers models for dense prediction tasks in the field of medical image analysis. The study assists in understanding the relationships between cell and tissue organization thereby providing a useful medium to look at the impact of cellular functions on human health.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Deep learning models can perform well in complex medical imaging classification tasks, even when basing their conclusions on spurious correlations (i.e. confounders), should they be prevalent in the training dataset, rather than on the causal image markers of interest. This would thereby limit their ability to generalize across the population. Explainability based on counterfactual image generation can be used to expose the confounders but does not provide a strategy to mitigate the bias. In this work, we introduce the first end-to-end training framework that integrates both (i) popular debiasing classifiers (e.g. distributionally robust optimization (DRO)) to avoid latching onto the spurious correlations and (ii) counterfactual image generation to unveil generalizable imaging markers of relevance to the task. Additionally, we propose a novel metric, Spurious Correlation Latching Score (SCLS), to quantify the extent of the classifier reliance on the spurious correlation as exposed by the counterfactual images. Through comprehensive experiments on two public datasets (with the simulated and real visual artifacts), we demonstrate that the debiasing method: (i) learns generalizable markers across the population, and (ii) successfully ignores spurious correlations and focuses on the underlying disease pathology.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Visual question answering is a task of predicting the answer to a question about an image. Given that different people can provide different answers to a visual question, we aim to better understand why with answer groundings. We introduce the first dataset that visually grounds each unique answer to each visual question, which we call VQAAnswerTherapy. We then propose two novel problems of predicting whether a visual question has a single answer grounding and localizing all answer groundings. We benchmark modern algorithms for these novel problems to show where they succeed and struggle.

<p>Abstract:<br>Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection has developed substantially in the past few years, with available methods approaching, and in a few cases achieving, perfect data separation on standard benchmarks. These results generally involve large or complex models, pretraining, exposure to OoD examples or extra hyperparameter tuning. Remarkably, it is possible to achieve results that can exceed many of these state-of-the-art methods with a very simple method. We demonstrate that ResNet18 trained with Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL) produces state-of-the-art results out-of-the-box on near and far OoD detection benchmarks using only Euclidean distance as a scoring rule. This may obviate the need in some cases for more sophisticated methods or larger models, and at the very least provides a very strong, easy to use baseline for further experimentation and analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Recent works have demonstrated success in MRI reconstruction using deep learning-based models. However, most reported approaches require training on a task-specific, large-scale dataset. Regularization by denoising (RED) is a general pipeline which embeds a denoiser as a prior for image reconstruction. The potential of RED has been demonstrated for multiple image-related tasks such as denoising, deblurring and super-resolution. In this work, we propose a regularization by neural style transfer (RNST) method to further leverage the priors from the neural transfer and denoising engine. This enables RNST to reconstruct a high-quality image from a noisy low-quality image with different image styles and limited data. We validate RNST with clinical MRI scans from 1.5T and 3T and show that RNST can significantly boost image quality. Our results highlight the capability of the RNST framework for MRI reconstruction and the potential for reconstruction tasks with limited data.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This work presents BundleSeg, a reliable, reproducible, and fast method for extracting white matter pathways. The proposed method combines an iterative registration procedure with a recently developed precise streamline search algorithm that enables efficient segmentation of streamlines without the need for tractogram clustering or simplifying assumptions. We show that BundleSeg achieves improved repeatability and reproducibility than state-of-the-art segmentation methods, with significant speed improvements. The enhanced precision and reduced variability in extracting white matter connections offer a valuable tool for neuroinformatic studies, increasing the sensitivity and specificity of tractography-based studies of white matter pathways.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can be optimized to obtain high-fidelity 3D scene reconstructions of objects and large-scale scenes. However, NeRFs require accurate camera parameters as input – inaccurate camera parameters result in blurry renderings. Extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters are usually estimated using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods as a pre-processing step to NeRF, but these techniques rarely yield perfect estimates. Thus, prior works have proposed jointly optimizing camera parameters alongside a NeRF, but these methods are prone to local minima in challenging settings. In this work, we analyze how different camera parameterizations affect this joint optimization problem, and observe that standard parameterizations exhibit large differences in magnitude with respect to small perturbations, which can lead to an ill-conditioned optimization problem. We propose using a proxy problem to compute a whitening transform that eliminates the correlation between camera parameters and normalizes their effects, and we propose to use this transform as a preconditioner for the camera parameters during joint optimization. Our preconditioned camera optimization significantly improves reconstruction quality on scenes from the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset: we reduce error rates (RMSE) by 67% compared to state-of-the-art NeRF approaches that do not optimize for cameras like Zip-NeRF, and by 29% relative to state-of-the-art joint optimization approaches using the camera parameterization of SCNeRF. Our approach is easy to implement, does not significantly increase runtime, can be applied to a wide variety of camera parameterizations, and can straightforwardly be incorporated into other NeRF-like models.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>We tackle the problem of learning complex, general behaviors directly in the real world. We propose an approach for robots to efficiently learn manipulation skills using only a handful of real-world interaction trajectories from many different settings. Inspired by the success of learning from large-scale datasets in the fields of computer vision and natural language, our belief is that in order to efficiently learn, a robot must be able to leverage internet-scale, human video data. Humans interact with the world in many interesting ways, which can allow a robot to not only build an understanding of useful actions and affordances but also how these actions affect the world for manipulation. Our approach builds a structured, human-centric action space grounded in visual affordances learned from human videos. Further, we train a world model on human videos and fine-tune on a small amount of robot interaction data without any task supervision. We show that this approach of affordance-space world models enables different robots to learn various manipulation skills in complex settings, in under 30 minutes of interaction.

<p>Abstract:<br>We study the problem of few-shot physically-aware articulated mesh generation. By observing an articulated object dataset containing only a few examples, we wish to learn a model that can generate diverse meshes with high visual fidelity and physical validity. Previous mesh generative models either have difficulties in depicting a diverse data space from only a few examples or fail to ensure physical validity of their samples. Regarding the above challenges, we propose two key innovations, including 1) a hierarchical mesh deformation-based generative model based upon the divide-and-conquer philosophy to alleviate the few-shot challenge by borrowing transferrable deformation patterns from large scale rigid meshes and 2) a physics-aware deformation correction scheme to encourage physically plausible generations. We conduct extensive experiments on 6 articulated categories to demonstrate the superiority of our method in generating articulated meshes with better diversity, higher visual fidelity, and better physical validity over previous methods in the few-shot setting. Further, we validate solid contributions of our two innovations in the ablation study.

<p>Abstract:<br>We present a framework for generating appropriate facial responses from a listener in dyadic social interactions based on the speaker’s words. Given an input transcription of the speaker’s words with their timestamps, our approach autoregressively predicts a response of a listener: a sequence of listener facial gestures, quantized using a VQ-VAE. Since gesture is a language component, we propose treating the quantized atomic motion elements as additional language token inputs to a transformer-based large language model. Initializing our transformer with the weights of a language model pre-trained only on text results in significantly higher quality listener responses than training a transformer from scratch. We show that our generated listener motion is fluent and reflective of language semantics through quantitative metrics and a qualitative user study. In our evaluation, we analyze the model’s ability to utilize temporal and semantic aspects of spoken text.

<p>Abstract:<br>We show how shadows can be efficiently generated in differentiable rendering of triangle meshes. Our central observation is that pre-filtered shadow mapping, a technique for approximating shadows based on rendering from the perspective of a light, can be combined with existing differentiable rasterizers to yield differentiable visibility information. We demonstrate at several inverse graphics problems that differentiable shadow maps are orders of magnitude faster than differentiable light transport simulation with similar accuracy – while differentiable rasterization without shadows often fails to converge.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Privacy-preserving machine learning aims to train models on private data without leaking sensitive information. Differential privacy (DP) is considered the gold standard framework for privacy-preserving training, as it provides formal privacy guarantees. However, compared to their non-private counterparts, models trained with DP often have significantly reduced accuracy. Private classifiers are also believed to exhibit larger performance disparities across subpopulations, raising fairness concerns. The poor performance of classifiers trained with DP has prevented the widespread adoption of privacy preserving machine learning in industry. Here we show that pre-trained foundation models fine-tuned with DP can achieve similar accuracy to non-private classifiers, even in the presence of significant distribution shifts between pre-training data and downstream tasks. We achieve private accuracies within a few percent of the non-private state of the art across four datasets, including two medical imaging benchmarks. Furthermore, our private medical classifiers do not exhibit larger performance disparities across demographic groups than non-private models. This milestone to make DP training a practical and reliable technology has the potential to widely enable machine learning practitioners to train safely on sensitive datasets while protecting individuals’ privacy.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>This is a further development of Vision Transformer Pruning via matrix decomposition. The purpose of the Vision Transformer Pruning is to prune the dimension of the linear projection of the dataset by learning their associated importance score in order to reduce the storage, run-time memory, and computational demands. In this paper we further reduce dimension and complexity of the linear projection by implementing and comparing several matrix decomposition methods while preserving the generated important features. We end up selected the Singular Value Decomposition as the method to achieve our goal by comparing the original accuracy scores in the original Github repository and the accuracy scores of using those matrix decomposition methods, including Singular Value Decomposition, four versions of QR Decomposition, and LU factorization.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Visual Place Recognition is a task that aims to predict the place of an image (called query) based solely on its visual features. This is typically done through image retrieval, where the query is matched to the most similar images from a large database of geotagged photos, using learned global descriptors. A major challenge in this task is recognizing places seen from different viewpoints. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new method, called EigenPlaces, to train our neural network on images from different point of views, which embeds viewpoint robustness into the learned global descriptors. The underlying idea is to cluster the training data so as to explicitly present the model with different views of the same points of interest. The selection of this points of interest is done without the need for extra supervision. We then present experiments on the most comprehensive set of datasets in literature, finding that EigenPlaces is able to outperform previous state of the art on the majority of datasets, while requiring 60% less GPU memory for training and using 50% smaller descriptors. The code and trained models for EigenPlaces are available at {\small{\url{<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/gmberton/EigenPlaces%7D%7D%7D">https://github.com/gmberton/EigenPlaces}}}</a>, while results with any other baseline can be computed with the codebase at {\small{\url{<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/gmberton/auto_VPR%7D%7D%7D">https://github.com/gmberton/auto_VPR}}}</a>.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>Hyperspectral Image (HSI) reconstruction has made gratifying progress with the deep unfolding framework by formulating the problem into a data module and a prior module. Nevertheless, existing methods still face the problem of insufficient matching with HSI data. The issues lie in three aspects: 1) fixed gradient descent step in the data module while the degradation of HSI is agnostic in the pixel-level. 2) inadequate prior module for 3D HSI cube. 3) stage interaction ignoring the differences in features at different stages. To address these issues, in this work, we propose a Pixel Adaptive Deep Unfolding Transformer (PADUT) for HSI reconstruction. In the data module, a pixel adaptive descent step is employed to focus on pixel-level agnostic degradation. In the prior module, we introduce the Non-local Spectral Transformer (NST) to emphasize the 3D characteristics of HSI for recovering. Moreover, inspired by the diverse expression of features in different stages and depths, the stage interaction is improved by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Experimental results on both simulated and real scenes exhibit the superior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art HSI reconstruction methods.

<p>Abstract:<br>Quantization scale and bit-width are the most important parameters when considering how to quantize a neural network. Prior work focuses on optimizing quantization scales in a global manner through gradient methods (gradient descent &amp; Hessian analysis). Yet, when applying perturbations to quantization scales, we observe a very jagged, highly non-smooth test loss landscape. In fact, small perturbations in quantization scale can greatly affect accuracy, yielding a $0.5-0.8%$ accuracy boost in 4-bit quantized vision transformers (ViTs). In this regime, gradient methods break down, since they cannot reliably reach local minima. In our work, dubbed Evol-Q, we use evolutionary search to effectively traverse the non-smooth landscape. Additionally, we propose using an infoNCE loss, which not only helps combat overfitting on the small calibration dataset ($1,000$ images) but also makes traversing such a highly non-smooth surface easier. Evol-Q improves the top-1 accuracy of a fully quantized ViT-Base by $10.30%$, $0.78%$, and $0.15%$ for $3$-bit, $4$-bit, and $8$-bit weight quantization levels. Extensive experiments on a variety of CNN and ViT architectures further demonstrate its robustness in extreme quantization scenarios.
